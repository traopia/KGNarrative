[{"Generated text": " Google launches German book library Google has launched its German-language library in San Francisco. The company said Wednesday that it plans to launch the German version of the Google Library in August. Google's search engine, which is based in Silicon Valley, will be available in the US as part of its "Google Library" initiative. According to Google executive Jennifer Grant, the company is looking to expand its library to include books from around the world. "We want to make it accessible to everyone," she told the Financial Times Deutschland, referring to the online book fair, Frankfurt Book Fair, in Frankfurt, Germany. She added that the library would be open to anyone who wanted to buy a book from a German publisher, Langenscheidt, as well as other publishers in Europe and the United States. In Germany, Google is the largest publisher of German books, with more than 100,000 titles in print and online, according to a report by the Association of American Publishers (AAPL). The library will also be able to offer books for sale on the Internet, a Google spokeswoman said, adding that Google would continue to work with publishers to ensure that their products meet the needs of their customers.

It will have a wide range of titles, ranging from classics to contemporary novels, and will include a selection of short stories, short fiction and non-fiction titles. But it will not be limited to books that are published in German. There are also a number of books which are available on other platforms, such as the Kindle, Apple and Google Reader, that can be used to search for books by people who have never read them before. This is not to say that there is no need for Google to publish books in other languages, but it is a step up from what it has done for the past few years, said Patricia Schroeder, vice president of publishing at Google, who has been working with the publisher for several years to develop a library for German publishers. However, she added, "we are not going to stop publishing books until we have the technology to do so." In a statement to Reuters, Hubert Haarmann, head of Germany's publishing industry association, told Reuters that he was "very excited" about the new library. He said he hoped it would open up "a whole new world" for publishers, especially those who are struggling to find books to sell in their home countries. “I am very excited about it,” he said in an interview with Reuters. And he also said that his company was looking into the possibility of expanding its online library into other countries, including the UK, where it already has a large library of over 1,500 titles on its bookshelf. As a result, he hopes that more publishers will come to Germany to read the books they are currently working on in order to improve the quality of life for their readers.  "I think it's a good idea to have an online bookstore in Germany," he added. That is, if you have access to all the titles you are looking for, you can find them on Google Books and other bookshelves, for example, on Amazon.com, or on Apple's Kindle store. At the same time, there are a lot of booksellers who sell their books online. These are the kind of companies that have been around for a long time and are very successful at selling books on their own. They have also been successful in attracting international buyers to their bookstores. So far, however, they have not had any trouble finding the right publisher to sign them up, although they do have to pay a fee for each book they sell. For this reason, many publishers are wary of signing up for such a huge library, even though they know it won't be easy for them to reach their target audience. Many publishers have already signed up with Google as a way of getting the word out about their new products and services. Some of them have even begun to consider the idea of using Google libraries as an alternative to traditional books. "
,"Reference text": " German Publishers Warm to Google Library Google is heading for a legal battle with American publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries. But German publishers seem warm to the idea. Five major US publishers filed suit in San Francisco on Wednesday to block Google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders. The project, already underway but stopped by Google in August, is the Silicon Valley company's bid to make the world's books searchable online. Five major libraries are already participating in the project and Google sent executive Jennifer Grant to the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday to present the idea to European and German book publishers. This week Google introduced print.google.de, the German version of the search engine Google posted online this time last year. Google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned. Users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online. The idea is to supplement Internet users with another source of material. In contrast to their American colleagues, German publishing houses have reacted well to the database. Some German publishers on board Google said that is discussing terms with all major German publishers. Langenscheidt, which publishes a large selection of dictionaries, said they had got on board. "We are starting with 160 books," Hubert Haarmann, head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher, told the Financial Times Deutschland. "We see it as an additional distribution possibility." An increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way Google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers. The company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine, and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books. Google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site. Not all German publishers are on board. In fact, the German association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books, rather than let someone else do it. The project is not a competitor to Google, but will allow publishers to create their own database, rather than turn it over to the search engine. If Google can, anyone can But American publishers don't want to even take that step. They fear a slippery slope if Google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material. "If Google can make … copies, then anyone can," Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, said in a phone interview with Reuters. "Anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything." At issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the "fair use" of their work by the public. Google argues that their search engine will only offer users a "card catalog" function, with a few pages of text. No one will be able to read the entire book online. " 

},{"Generated text": " Barack Obama on Cuba: 'Sermon on the Mount' US President Barack Obama has spoken out against the communist regime in Cuba. In a speech delivered in Havana on Wednesday, the US president said he was "deeply concerned" about the situation in the Caribbean island nation. "I am deeply concerned," Obama said. The speech was delivered by Cuban President Raul Castro, who was born in 1961 and raised in Mariel, Cuba, according to the United States Department of State. It was the first speech by a Cuban president since the end of the Cold War, and it marked the beginning of a new era in US relations with the island country. Obama also said that he would work to improve relations between the two countries. But he also called on Congress to pass a bill that would allow the Cuban government to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which had been closed since 1961. This bill would have allowed the government of Cuba to open the prison, but it did not pass the Senate and the House of Representatives. Instead, it was passed by both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Obama in 2000. Astrid Prange, a member of DW's Latin America team, told DW that Obama's speech came as a surprise to many Cubans who had never heard of him before. He said, however, that "the Cuban people have a lot to be proud of," and that it would be "a great honor" for him to have been able to do so. However, he added, "It's a shame that we have to go through this again and again." The US government has been accused of using torture and other forms of torture against Cuban citizens, including the use of force against them by the military and torture of their captors. That is not the case at all. There is no evidence that the regime has used torture in any way, shape or form. What is clear is that there is a clear and present danger to those who seek to use torture as an instrument of war against their own people. And it's not just the American people who are concerned about this. They are also concerned that, in some cases, they are being used as weapons of mass destruction. For example, there are reports that a number of people were killed at the hands of US forces in Brazil in January, when they tried to take part in an anti-Castro demonstration in a bid to stop US troops from entering the country, as well as in other countries, such as Brazil, Brazil and Brazil. At the same time, US officials have accused Cuba of being a "hostile state" and of trying to force its citizens to give up their right to self-determination. These accusations are not supported by facts. According to a US official, this is the most serious allegation that has ever been made against Cuba by US authorities. US intelligence agencies have concluded that Cuba's government is in violation of international law and is actively seeking to undermine the rule of law in order to protect the interests of its own citizens. As a result, many US citizens have fled to Cuba in search of safety and security, while others have returned to their home countries to seek refuge in their countries of origin. Many of those fleeing war and persecution are now living in countries that have long been ruled by authoritarian regimes. Some of them have even fled their homes to escape the violence. Others have gone to war with their native countries and are seeking asylum in neighboring countries like Brazil or Venezuela. DW spoke to one of these people and asked him if he had any regrets about his decision to leave Cuba and whether he still wanted to return to his homeland. His answer: "No, I don't think so." In his speech, Obama spoke of his desire to "make Cuba a better place for its people." He also made clear that his goal was to make it a more peaceful and prosperous country for all to live in, not only for themselves but for the entire world. On the other hand, his words were not enough to convince many people that this was a good idea. After all, what good would it do for a country like Cuba if it had a democratic constitution and a strong constitution? "We are going to build a system that will allow us to work together as one country," he said in his address to Congress. 'We will not allow this to happen again' "
,"Reference text": " Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist "enemy," and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word "embargo" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a "new chapter" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called "rogue states" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this "wall in the mind" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies. "

The Council is set to meet on January 13 to decide on the next steps of the EU's rotating presidency. The president will be accompanied by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who is due to take the oath of office at the end of his term next month. Italy is the only country in the 27-member bloc that has not yet ratified the new constitution, which was approved by the Council in 2006. However, EU leaders are expected to vote on whether to ratify the constitution as early as next week. "We are very concerned about the situation in Italy," President Giorgio Napoletti said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that he was "deeply concerned" that the country would not be able to continue as a member state if it did not sign up to the treaty. He added that Italy would continue to cooperate with other EU member states, including the United States, as long as they were willing to work with the bloc in order to reach a common goal of an EU-wide free trade agreement. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters) - type-of-the-nation (EU-IMA) The EU has said that it will not allow Italy to sign a treaty that would allow it to join the single market. It has also said it would consider a number of other options, such as an arms embargo or an outright ban on imports of certain goods from other countries, if Italy does not agree to such a move by EU members. There is also the possibility of a bilateral agreement between Italy and the US, where the two countries have agreed to a free-trade agreement, but Italy has yet to agree on a deal on such an accord, according to European Commission sources. EU officials have said they have no plans to impose sanctions on Italy for failing to comply with EU rules on arms imports, and that they would only be imposed if the Italian government complied with its obligations under the terms of its EU membership. European leaders have also expressed concern over the lack of progress in negotiations with Italy over arms control. They have called for a new round of talks to be held in Brussels in early January to see if there is any progress on that front. In a sign of growing concern, European officials said on Tuesday that there was a "clear and present danger" in talks with Italian officials over a possible extension of EU sanctions against Russia, China, Iran and North Korea over its alleged involvement in an alleged cyber-espionage campaign against the Syrian regime. US President Barack Obama has called on Italian President-elect Donald Trump to step down from his post as head of state, saying he would be "unprecedentedly irresponsible" if he were to leave office. Obama's call for an end to sanctions "would be a grave mistake," Obama said at a news conference in Washington, D.C. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that Washington was not ready to give up its support for the move to end the war in Syria. According to US officials, the decision was made "in good faith" after a meeting between US and Italian leaders in New York and Washington last week in which they discussed the issue of arms controls and how to limit the use of force against Syria and Iran. Both sides agreed that sanctions should be lifted if they are to prevent the spread of terrorism and other forms of violence against civilians. But the president said he had no reason to believe that this was going to happen and said the negotiations would go ahead as planned. On the other hand, he said, "there is a clear danger that we will have a situation where we are unable to do what we want to achieve in this regard." The US president, however, rejected the idea of imposing sanctions in return for Italy agreeing to an unconditional ceasefire with Russia and saying it was too risky for any country to act on its own accord. Washington has repeatedly warned Italy against doing so and warned that if sanctions were imposed, it could lead to further escalation of tensions with Moscow and Beijing. "

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. "I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows," he said, adding. "I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding." Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as "King George." The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters) " 

},{"Generated text": " Israeli Ambassador to Iran Danny Ayalon: Iran is the only country in the Middle East that does not recognize Israel as a sovereign state. The US and Israel have a long history of hostility towards Iran. In 2002, the Iranian ambassador to the US was arrested in Geneva, Switzerland, and sentenced to life in prison. He was charged with espionage and attempted murder for allegedly supporting the regime of former Israeli Prime Minister Moammar Gadhafi. During his trial, he was found guilty of spying for Israel, but was acquitted of all charges of espionage. US President Barack Obama said in a statement that the charges against him were politically motivated. "The Iranian regime is not a democratic country," he said, adding that he did not believe that Israel was responsible for the crimes committed against the Sunii in 2002 and 2006. But he also said that Iran was a "state sponsor of terrorism" and that it had no role in any of the alleged crimes against humanity committed by the Israeli regime. Iran has been accused of supporting Israel in Libya and in Syria. Israel has denied this accusation, saying it was an act of war perpetrated by Iran in order to protect its own interests. However, Israeli officials have said the accusations against Iran are "baseless," and they have not been proven to be true. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has also accused Israel of trying to undermine Iran's sovereignty over the region, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism and of attempting to interfere with the legitimate government of Israel. Tehran has repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them "absurd." "Iran has always been a state sponsor," said Iranian Foreign Minister Danny Aiyalon in an interview with DW, referring to his country's relationship with Israel during the Arab-Israeli conflict in 2006 and 2007, when he fled to Lebanon with his wife and two young children to seek refuge in Saudi Arabia, where he had been living for more than a decade. Ayalon also denied accusations of plotting to overthrow Israel's government in return for a peace deal with its former ally, North Korean leader, Ayatollahs, in 1996. According to Iranian officials, this was the first time Iran had acted as an intermediary between Israel and the P5+1, a group of Sunni-Shia-majority countries that were allied with Iran at the time of its overthrow by Saddam Hussein in 1991. At the same time, Iran and North Korea were at loggerheads over who should be allowed to run the country, which was then under the control of Saddam's regime, according to a UN report. It is Iran that has the most influence on the West, as well as the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia. This influence is also reflected in Tehran's policy towards the Palestinians, particularly in its support of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran-allied militias, including the so-called "Islamic State" (ISI). The Iranian government has long maintained that its goal is to establish an independent state in Palestine. That is why the UN has called for an end to its "war on terror," which has led to an increase in tensions between the two countries. As a result, it has increased the number of Shia and Sunni groups in Iran, who have been fighting each other for decades. And it's not just the Shia who are fighting for their right to self-determination. There are also Sunni and Shi'ite groups, such as Hezbollah, that have fought alongside Israel since the beginning of time. These groups have also fought against Israel for many years, even though Israel is now the world's largest Shiite power. They are now fighting alongside Iran on a regional level. DW: Do you think that this is a good thing? Danny: I don't think so. I think it is an important thing to think about. What is important for us is that we have the ability to do something about it. We have to act on our own. Do we want to make sure that there is no conflict between us and our neighbors? I do not think we can do anything about that. If we do that, then we will not be able to have peace in this region. So let's be clear: We are not going to allow Iran to dictate what is acceptable and acceptable to us. Let's have an honest discussion about what we are willing to give up in exchange for peace and stability in our region." The Israeli-Iranian relationship is very different from the one between them. Both countries have different political and economic interests, both in their own countries and outside of their borders. For the past two decades, they've maintained a close relationship. "
,"Reference text": " 'Bond between Israel and the US is unshakeable' Israel’s former deputy foreign minister and Israeli Ambassador to the US Danny Ayalon spoke to DW this week about whether the Iranian nuclear deal has been a game changer in the relations between the US and Israel. Danny Ayalon has served as Israel's deputy foreign minister and was Ambassador to the US from 2002-2006. DW: Have US-Israeli relations been damaged in light of the Geneva agreement? Danny Ayalon: Israel-US relations will not be affected by the agreement in Geneva with Iran. Yes, we do have our apprehensions; we do have our criticisms; but this is something that is legitimate between allies just as we have our different points of view about settlements, or about what should be the content of agreement with the Palestinians. The unshakeable bond between Israel and US is going to last on the natural alliance and political-strategical value of this alliance. Israel has proven again to be the only dependable ally for the US in the region in terms of American interests; in terms of countering and fighting proliferation of nuclear weapons - which is one of the most important things for American stability. How would you characterize relations at the moment between the US and Iran? I think it's very important to note that under President Obama the military cooperation and relationship between Israel and the US has reached an all time high and this continues. It's not just the administration though, it's also Congress, it's the people and the nationwide support that Israel enjoys in the US. This will not change although Israel has criticized and will continue to criticize the agreement with Iran. What do you think is behind the thinking of the Iranian leadership? The Iranians see two models - in terms of non-proliferation or in terms of dismantling the nuclear capabilities. They see Libya under the Gadhafi model and they see the North Korean model. Libya under Gadhafi voluntarily dismantled their capabilities and where is Libya now, where is Gadhafi now? On the other hand a decade ago the North Koreans went through what seemed like a consensual route and, boom, after a few years they detonated a nuclear device. For the Ayatollahs the nuclear capability is not just an objective in itself, it's a means for two things - to become the hegemony and the dominant force in the Middle East; secondly to put down the Sunii countries like Saudi Arabia and lastly their own internal stability. By becoming nuclear they believe it will be an insurance policy for them. The six parties involved in talks in Geneva should not be fooled by the charm offense of the Iranians because the Iranians came to Geneva not as a consequence of a policy change but as a consequence of their being on the brink economically. The main goal of Iran is to lift the sanctions and they have managed to do that without giving up any of their potential. Why does Israel's leadership think the Geneva agreement is bad? I believe that this agreement is bad on all accounts. It's not going to stop a nuclear Iran. Because of the message, it's going to make stabilizing the region much more difficult. It's going to induce more negative energy into the region in terms of terrorism, in terms of the Sunni-Shia clashes and it's quite obvious to foes and friends alike of the West that Iran has the upper hand. The danger is that Iran keeps the nuclear potential, the capabilities and the initiative in the hands of Ayatollahs. Any time in the future they can resume, they can actually accelerate their nuclear programme. The fact that Iran was on brink was not used well diplomatically by the six parties in the talks, because they could have gotten much more out of Iran. Iran played a brilliant game when they made the P5+1 blink first. The message to the region is that the belligerency of Iran pays off and that strengthens Assad, Hezbollah and all the very extreme radical forces. It also creates the counter offensive by the Sunni extremists. Where does this leave Israel? I think Israel's hands are now tied and there is no option at this point but the diplomatic option. Now it's just a matter of keeping Iran committed and answerable to the letter of the Geneva agreement. I don't think that this will be very simple to do. If a country is determined they can really overcome any monitoring regime, even the most robust. The last opportunity the international community has will be when the terms of the agreement are up in six months. When the P5+1 comes to the table for the final status agreement with Iran, this is the time to make all the demands with Iran. I don't think Middle East and the world can tolerate, or survive a nuclear Iran. Unfortunately it's been painted as if the duel in the Middle East is between Tehran and Jerusalem. It's not the case. The the threat of Tehran is first and foremost to the Gulf countries, to the Sunni countries, then to Israel and then to Europe. If you look at their delivery systems and their ideology it does not stop only in the Middle East. "

The Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger reported on Monday that Switzerland would be hosting the tournament for the first time since the start of the 20th century. "Swiss football is the most important sport in Switzerland," said Urs Stadler, a sports journalist with the Swiss daily newspaper "Tages Agerpres." The newspaper, which is owned by Prisec and Securitas, said Switzerland was the only country not to be invited to the competition. However, the newspaper also reported that a number of other countries were also invited, including France, Croatia, Poland, Russia, Spain, France and Italy. According to a report by the German news agency DPA, Switzerland had been invited by Germany's sports ministry to attend the event, but was not invited due to security concerns. In a statement released Monday, Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that he was "deeply concerned" about the situation at the moment, adding that "it is a very difficult situation for Switzerland to overcome." "We have a lot of work ahead of us," he said, referring to Switzerland's hosting rights. But he added that it was important to ensure that the government was prepared to take the necessary steps to make sure that security was in place at all times. He also stressed the importance of ensuring that all security measures were taken in order to protect the interests of all Swiss citizens, especially those who live in countries with high unemployment and high living costs, such as those in France or Germany, who have high rates of poverty and who are unable to afford to live on their own. It is also important for Germany to show that they are willing to do what it takes to compete in a fair and fair manner, as well as to provide security for its citizens. Germany is expected to play host to France next week, while Poland and Poland will be on the short list of countries that are likely to qualify for next year's tournament. At the same time, Germany will have to decide whether it wants to send its athletes to Russia or Greece, where they will compete as part of a host nation. There is no official word yet on whether the two countries have agreed on a date, or if they have yet to agree on an exact date. On the other hand, there is speculation that Germany may be in for a surprise if it does decide to invite its players to join the squad. If that happens, it will not be the last time the team from Switzerland has to travel to Germany. That is not the case, however, because Germany has already announced its intention to bring its own squad to Europe next summer. As a result, many Swiss fans have already begun to tune in to watch the games on television and on social media. Some have even taken to Twitter to express their delight at being invited. Others have expressed concern over the possibility of Germany being excluded from the group stage, saying it is "a shame" that such a decision has been made. German media have been reporting on this issue for months, with reports saying that German officials have threatened to pull out all the stops to prevent Germany from making the final. Many have also accused Germany of being a "host country" and that this could be seen as an attempt to influence the decision of which country to go to. While the Germans have not ruled out the idea of sending their players, some observers have suggested that their decision could have an impact on how the game is played. They have said they would rather see Germany take part in an international competition, rather than a regional one, and this is something that has not been discussed in recent years. For example, if Germany does not want to participate in Europe, then it may not even be able to get a visa to visit the United States. This could lead to an increase in tensions between Germany and Switzerland. And it could also be an opportunity for Russia and Spain to gain a foothold in their respective countries. So far, so good, in fact, that is what has led to speculation about whether Germany might be interested in participating in Euro 2009. "

"We have to turn to about 500 private security personnel from Germany," Urs Stadler, spokesman for a security firm consortium told the Monday, May 26, edition of Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger. "Most of them were already in operation during the World Cup two years ago, and have relevant experience," added Stadler from Prisec, a consortium made up of the companies Protectas and Securitas. The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers "due to pending assignments." Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called "a catalyst for violence" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests. France will offer the third largest contingent with 750 officers and Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Greece, Russia and Spain will also send reinforcements. "

"The investigation is ongoing," the statement said, adding that it was "clear that there was no evidence to support the allegations made by the investigators." "This is not the first time that this has happened," said Sven Lau, a spokesman for the Christian Democrat party whip, in an interview with the newspaper "Die Welt am Sonntag." In the same interview, Lau also accused the interior minister of trying to cover up the case, saying that he had "no idea" what was going on in his own home. According to the Bild news agency, police were also investigating a case of arson in which a man was shot to death by an al-Qaida-linked Salafi group after he refused to give up his weapon. A statement from the head of the anti-terror committee, Ayman A. Mazyek, denied the accusations, calling them "baseless." He also denied allegations that a police officer had shot the man, accusing him of being a "terrorist" and saying the attack was an act of terrorism. msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)In a separate report published on Sunday, German state broadcaster Tagesspiegel said the investigation was being carried out "in the interest of justice and the public interest." It was not immediately clear whether the inquiry would lead to charges of murder or manslaughter, but it is thought that Maas and his wife, Heiko, had acted in self-defense. On the contrary, they have been accused of "insulting" the police and other security officials, as well as a number of other crimes, including the murder of two police officers and a bomb threat against a mosque in a southern German town in August. It is unclear how many people were killed or injured, or whether they were targeted. However, it appears that at least one person was seriously injured. Police have said they are still searching for a suspect, and police have not yet released the names of those who were shot or killed. Anti-Islamist group Islamic State (ISI) The ISI has called for an end to violence against Muslims and said it will continue to carry out attacks on Muslims, especially if the perpetrators are found guilty of crimes against humanity. ISIS is a terrorist organization and has been outlawed in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iran since August, when it claimed responsibility for setting fire to an Islamic holy shrine in one of its holiest sites in Düsseldorf, killing hundreds of worshippers and injuring thousands of people. Its members are believed to be affiliated with a radical group called the Ansar Al-Sharia (Islamic State). The group has denied any involvement in any of these attacks, although it has said its activities are not linked to terrorism and that they do not have any links to any terrorist organizations. Last month, an imam was arrested in connection with an attack on a school in eastern Germany that claimed the lives of 16 students and three staff members. After the arrest, he was taken into custody and charged with attempted murder. His lawyer, Volker Kauder, said he would appeal for his client's release. But he did not rule out the possibility of an appeal against the charges, arguing that such a move would be "unacceptable" in light of recent developments in recent months. "

The 33-year-old behind the patrols claimed that their goal was only to raise attention. Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo "Shariah police" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. "Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil," de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. "Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police." Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that "the state alone" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. "Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do," Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a "Sharia police" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. "We knew that this would raise attention," Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native Mönchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group "Invitation to Paradise." (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. "These few teen yobs do not speak in our name," chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. "These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims." Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to "sorcery." msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters) "

"We need to end it," Stefanie Albrecht, a Berlin environmental activist, said on Saturday, 20.09.2014. Germany's largest environmental NGO, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), has called on the European Union (EU) to take action against the problem, saying it is "unacceptable" that the country's biggest city, Berlin, has become a dumping ground for illegal dumping of garbage. The CSIRO, which is responsible for cleaning up the city's garbage, says it has been working for more than 30 years to address the issue. It is also working on a plan to reduce the amount of waste that is dumped in Germany each year, according to Thomas Fischer, an environmental researcher at the CSO. He said that in order to do so, "we have to make sure that we don't let the garbage get into our cities." "It is unacceptable that Germany has to deal with this problem," he said, adding that he would like to see a change in the way Germany deals with it. Change.org has launched an online petition platform that aims to stop the "great Pacific garbage patch" from becoming a reality by the year 2050. In the past two decades, there have been at least 10,000 cases of people dumping garbage in Berlin's Tempelhofer Feld neighborhood. Since the 1990s, it's been estimated that about 1.5 million people have died from the so-called "Great Pacific" garbage Patch. According to a study published in 2002, this number is expected to rise to 2.4 million by 2040, with a total of 3.6 million deaths from it in 2030. A number of countries, including the United States, Ireland and China, have also been affected by it, and the EU is working to prevent it from happening again. However, Germany is not the only country that has suffered from a problem of its own: China and Kenya are among the worst offenders, while Kenya and South Africa are the most severely affected. As a result, more people are dying every year due to their lack of access to clean drinking water. This has led to an increase in deaths and injuries among young people, as well as a rise in suicide rates among older people who are unable to afford to pay for basic necessities such as food, clothing and medical care. These deaths have caused a lot of concern among environmental groups, who have called for a halt to global trash dumping. They are particularly concerned about the impact of climate change on people's health and well-being, particularly in developing countries like the developing world, where the climate is changing rapidly and there is a growing threat of a global warming crisis. Many of these problems are exacerbated by rising sea levels and rising temperatures. Climate change is one of those factors, but it also has a negative impact on human health. For example, in 1988, China banned the use of mercury in its water supply. And in 1998, Kenya banned its chemical industry from using mercury as an energy source. That was followed by a similar ban in Kenya. Today, mercury is the leading cause of death in many developing nations. There is no evidence that mercury has increased in any of them. But there are still concerns that it could be linked to climate-change-related diseases. What is more worrying is that this could lead to higher levels of human-caused illness and death among younger people. If this happens, then there will be more deaths among children and people with weakened immune systems who may not be able to cope with the consequences of their illness. So far, however, no one has found a cure for mercury poisoning in Europe. Only a handful of European countries have banned mercury from entering their cities. Even in countries with high concentrations of greenhouse gases, like Germany, that have a high level of carbon dioxide emissions. Most countries do not allow mercury to be stored in their rivers, lakes, oceans or rivers. Therefore, they are not allowed to import mercury into their waters, even if they want to. Some countries are also considering a ban on mercury-based products. Others are considering banning mercury products from their water supplies. "
,"Reference text": " Will Berlin be the next city to ban plastic bags? They are sturdy, thin and can handle a heavy load, but after a single use, plastic bags often end up outdoors or in oceans - with disastrous impacts. But a student in Berlin is trying to halt the plastic bag invasion. It started off as a student job: Stefanie Albrecht contacted the environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe to support its campaign in Berlin of approaching citizens on the streets to swap their plastic bags for reusable bags. The organization hoped to make people more aware of the environmentally destructive effects of plastic bags. Deutsche Umwelthilfe's anti-plastic bag campaign on Saturday (20.09.2014) also reused the bags campaigners collected off the streets. About 1,000 people strung together a 9-kilometer-long chain made of 30,000 plastic bags at the Tempelhofer Feld in the German capital Berlin, creating a world record. In Berlin alone, 30,000 plastic bags leave shops and market stalls every hour - amounting to 259 million bags a year. Across Germany, about 17 million plastic bags are consumed every day - or 6 billion a year. Albrecht, a natural resources management student, buys secondhand clothes, grows her own vegetables and tries to reduce her rubbish. But even she hadn't always been so conscious of the environmental problem that plastic bags present. "Before, I never thought about plastics and crude oil," she said. Stimulated by the conversations she had with strangers in the streets, she was motivated to sensitize others on the issue. In reading studies on polyethylene bags, she found out that 260 million liters (1.6 million barrels) of crude oil are processed into the plastic bags used over one year in Germany alone - not to mention the energy also needed in oil extraction and bag production. Eco-threat Plastic presents so many advantages: it is lightweight, strong, durable, waterproof, and cheap to produce. After the first department store in Germany started handing out plastic bags in 1961, many retailers followed. This packaging can be reused many times, and it is also recyclable. But because they are given away, plastic bags are carelessly disposed of: a plastic bag is typically used for 25 minutes on average - from the shop until you get back home. Plastic degrades very slowly in nature, over 100 to 500 years. In fact it never actually biodegrades - plastic just breaks down into ever-smaller pieces. And they can have fatal effects in the environment. Many places on land and water have become covered in a layer of plastic bags, bottles, canisters, furniture, forks and toothbrushes. In the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a swirling island of plastic trash covers thousands of square kilometers. Plastic bags cause wild animals to die miserably. Animals think the plastic is food, and eat it. This can cause them to choke, and suffocate slowly. Or they starve to death: the material can't be digested and excreted, so it clogs the stomach and intestines. Animals can also get caught and strangle themselves in plastic; or it can cut off circulation to a limb, leading to a different type of slow and painful death. Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) recently found plastic in every second seabird off the coast of Australia. CSIRO has warned that continued plastic production could cause extinction of 95 percent of all living animals in the region by 2050. Fish, sea turtles, whales, dolphins, sea cows, crocodiles and crustaceans could all go the way of the dodo. Economic approach Stefanie Albrecht was shocked to learn all this. Together with the Deutsche Umwelthilfe, she collected signatures on the online petition platform Change.org to demand that the German government enact a law taxing thin plastic bags. Within only three weeks, the 100,000 signatures for that online petition had been gathered. Stefanie Albrecht is now planning to personally hand over the list to the German government. Other countries are ahead of Germany: retailers in Ireland have been taxing plastic bags since 2002. There, consumption of plastic bags has decreased from 328 to 16 on average per person due to the tax. In Germany, annual consumption is at 76 plastic bags per head - a lot lower than the European average of 198 bags. "Germany has more than 80 million inhabitants. By reducing our per person consumption, we can achieve greater impact than many other countries in the European Union," pointed out Thomas Fischer of Deutsche Umwelthilfe. A minimum charge of 22 cents could cause the consumer to rethink his plastic bag habit: "Do I really need this bag, or can I put the goods in my backpack?" Fischer said in describing the hypothetical question. Bans in other areas In Bangladesh, plastic bags were banned after plastic waste clogged sewers and led to flooding in 1988 and 1998. China, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa have also banned ultra-thin plastic bags. Many cities in the "

The WHO has warned that the outbreak could spread to other countries, including Nigeria, Nigeria and Nigeria. WHO chief medical officer Brima Kargbo told reporters on Friday that there was a "very high risk" of spreading the virus. "There is a very high chance that this outbreak will spread," she said, referring to the epidemic that has killed more than 1,600 people since the beginning of this year, according to a WHO report released on Thursday. A WHO spokesman said the agency was working closely with medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) to assess the situation in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, as well as to determine the extent to which the disease is spreading in those countries. MSF spokesman Joanne Liu said there were no immediate reports of any new cases, but the WHO said it was "extremely concerned" about the possibility of an outbreak. In a statement, the UN said that it had not yet received any information about a possible outbreak, and that "it is not possible to confirm or deny the existence of such a outbreak." "We have received no information at this time," the statement said. However, it added that a number of cases have been reported in other parts of Africa, such as in Nigeria where there are no confirmed cases and in Cameroon, where the country is hosting the Youth Olympics for the first time since May 24, when the International Olympics Committee (IOC) approved the entry of 100,000 people into the games. According to WHO data, about 1.5 million people have died from Ebola, which is the highest recorded death toll in Africa. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)The WHO also warned against the spread of disease, saying it could cause "serious health problems" in countries where it is endemic. It also cautioned against underestimating the risk of infection in a country with a high level of infectious diseases, particularly in developing countries like Nigeria which has a low level with which to deal with the Ebola epidemic. Pakistan's health ministry said on its website that 80 percent of people who have contracted Ebola in recent years had died of it, compared to about 10 percent for Nigeria's population of 2.6 million.

They have also asked the international community to help them in their efforts to reach out to affected countries in order to ensure that they receive medical aid and help with their own medical bills and medical expenses, if they are unable to attend the events in Geneva on August 13 and 14, or if there is no humanitarian aid available to them at that time, they would be forced to travel to neighboring countries to seek medical help and treatment for Ebola patients and their families, WHO officials said in an official statement Friday, adding that humanitarian assistance could be provided by China and other international organizations to countries that have already received aid from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the IUCN (International Organization for Migration) in its fight against Ebola and its spread in South-East Asia and Africa (IEA). ipxs/ti (Isaios, EPA, DPA, wire agency)  ix/tsj, ibuprofen, chlax difficile, copper, zinc, iron ore, lead zinc and zinc to be used as raw materials for cooking and drinking water, among other things, said a spokesman for China's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, who is coordinating the humanitarian response to Ebola.

Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires "extraordinary measures." The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. "It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to," Liu told reporters. "Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure," she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the "upper hand" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. "If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region," Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. "We need people with a hands-on operational mindset," to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been "vastly underestimated" and that "extraordinary measures" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. "We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected."

A Luxembourg court on Tuesday ruled that Oracle had infringed the rights of copyright holders in the case, and that the company should be allowed to continue to operate in Europe without the EU's approval. "The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled in favor of Oracle," the Luxembourg-based firm said in an emailed statement. It said the court's decision was based on a "technical dispute" between Oracle and the German government over the use of copyrighted material, which is used to sell CDs, DVDs and other digital media. In a separate ruling, the ECJ said Oracle was entitled to the same rights as other companies that use copyrighted materials, such as CDs and DVDs, as long as they comply with EU copyright law.

Oracle, however, said it would not be able to defend itself against the claims, saying it had no legal basis to do so. http://www.amazon.com/amazonaws/dp/b00b0b7jh hgt/msz-dpa The case was brought by a group of lawyers from Germany, Luxembourg, US and US, who said they wanted Oracle to be held responsible for the infringement of intellectual property rights. They also argued that a court should have the right to decide whether Oracle's patents were protected by copyright laws, or whether the patents should only be used by companies with a certain level of commercial interest in their products and services. One lawyer for Oracle said he would appeal the decision, while the other lawyer said his client was "very happy" with the outcome. Both sides have been in court since June, when a European court in Luxembourg decided to acquit Oracle of trademark infringement charges for allegedly infringing copyright and trademark rights under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMK) of US law, according to court documents filed by lawyers representing the firm.

It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. "The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union," UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming "perfect legal safety on the market."

The US space agency said Thursday that the rover had successfully explored Aeolis Mons in Gale Crater. Curiosity is set to return to Mars on August 5 with a mission to explore the rocky planet. "We're very excited," Curiosity rover manager Jennifer Tropser said in a statement on Thursday, adding that she was "very pleased" with the results of the mission, which was launched on Wednesday by NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). "I'm very pleased that we've been able to confirm that this is indeed the case," she said. Scientists have been trying to determine the exact location of Curiosity's landing site for several weeks, but so far so good that they haven't found any evidence of an impact. Manned by the US rover Curiosity, the Mars science laboratory's first lander, is expected to reach the site in about two weeks. It is believed to be about 1.93-billion-euro ($2.5 billion) worth of landings, and that it could be used as a landing pad for future missions. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters) - type of footer The rover is scheduled to land on its first Martian landing since landing on Mars in August 2015. On its second landing, Curiosity will take a closer look at the Martian surface before returning to its original landing spot on September 5, when it is due to resume its exploratory activities. NASA has said it will send a team of scientists to the surface of Mars to assess the impact of its landing and determine whether the landing will have a positive impact on Earth's climate, weather and soil conditions, as well as the amount of time it would take for Curiosity to complete its mission and get to know the terrain and its inhabitants, according to a NASA press release.   The mission is being funded by US taxpayer money, NASA said, in part by a grant from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help cover the cost of landing Curiosity in the red planet, where it has been exploring for nearly two years. At the time of launch, it was estimated that Curiosity would spend around two to three weeks exploring the area, followed by three to four months of exploration and then a final landing in late August or early September. In all, there were about 2,500 people on board the spacecraft at that time, a total of 3,000 of whom were on their way back to Earth. Today, they will spend the next two months looking for signs of life, including the discovery of a new crater and the possibility of discovering new life on Europa, Mars' most famous crater, Europa's largest moon, Glenelg, near the southernmost point of our solar system. They hope to find the crater by early next year, if they can find it, before the end of this year's Martian season, after which they expect to make their first landing. However, some of them are concerned about the risks associated with landing too close to home, especially if the weather conditions are too warm and too hot for them to get a good grip on Martian soil. As a result, many people are worried about their safety, particularly those who are not familiar with Martian terrain, say they have no idea what to expect when they land or how long they'll be out there, or what they're going to do with their bodies. Many of these fears are unfounded, however, because they don't know what kind of conditions they are in. For example, one in five people who have never been on a Mars surface have died, while another has died from a heart attack or a torn ligament, says NASA. But that doesn't mean that there is no danger of getting trapped on this planet again, said Troopser. She added that "there is a lot of uncertainty about what the future holds for us as we get closer to our next landing."  "It's very exciting to see what we can do about this new discovery. We're really excited about it because it's a really exciting prospect and we're looking forward to seeing how it all plays out. I think we'll see how well it pans out," the NASA mission manager added. "

NASA's Mars rover, "Curiosity," will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to "drive, drive, drive" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. "Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly," Tropser said. "The success so far of these activities has been outstanding." Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site.

The report, titled "The Future of Aging" (2015-2020), predicts that by 2050, China will be the world's leading country in terms of the number of people aged 65 and older. According to the World Report, the country's population will grow faster than that of any other major industrialized country. China is the fastest growing country, with a population of more than 2.5 billion people, compared to 1.2 billion in the United States. In China, population growth is expected to reach 3.6 percent by 2020, up from 2 percent in 2015. However, there are still concerns about the impact of aging on health, particularly among young people. "China's ageing population has grown rapidly in recent years," the report said, adding that it was "increasingly concerned about its own health." "It is becoming more and more apparent that we are going to have to cut back on the amount of time we spend on our own," it said. It added that there was a "growing awareness" among younger people that the aging process is affecting their physical and mental well-being, and that they should be able to take care of themselves and their families. This is particularly true in China where there is a growing awareness that aging is not just a disease, it is also a health problem. We have seen this in other developing countries, such as India, where the elderly are more likely to die from old age than from new age, as well as in countries like Brazil, Russia, India and China. These are the countries that have the highest rates of ageing, but which are also the most vulnerable to disease and illness.   This report is based on a survey of 1,000 Chinese adults aged between 60 and 65 years old, which was conducted between 2015 and 2016 and is available online at www.worldreport.gov.cn/index.html  The results of this survey were published on Wednesday, April 25, 2015, at a time when China was the largest country by population, followed closely by the US and the European Union, according to a report released on Thursday, May 24, 2016, in response to growing concerns over the health of older people and how their health would be affected by aging.

World health experts said the study found that people with high levels of dementia and Alzheimer's disease have a higher risk of dying from these diseases than those without a high level of physical or mental health problems. They also said that elderly people are at greater risk from cardiovascular disease than people without dementia, because of their age and because they have more complex immune systems that can be treated with antibiotics and other treatments. Health experts also cautioned against underestimating the risks of such diseases and said it could be difficult to predict the extent to which they will spread over time. Experts also warned that this could lead to an increase in deaths from cancer and heart disease due to aging, especially among children and people who are in their late 20s and early 30s. But they cautioned that these risks could also be mitigated by a combination of lifestyle factors and lifestyle changes. For example, they said: "If you have children, you can expect to see a decline in your health as you age. That is why you will need to reduce your smoking and alcohol intake. You will also see that smoking is increasing in some areas of your diet and your physical activity." The authors also noted that obesity and diabetes are among the leading causes of death among men and women who have been diagnosed with cancer. And they also pointed out that "smoking is an important factor in determining whether or not they can live long enough to develop long-term healthy lifestyles."  These findings are important for the future of life expectancy. "

People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to "pursue new activities" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in "low and middle income" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says "all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's "no typical older person," though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, "aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time." Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with "life transitions," such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and "evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons." Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating "age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of "aging issues" worldwide. But don't forget: "a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole." "

The Finnish driver took home the title in Hockenheim on Sunday, beating Michael Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya in the final race of the season. "It's a great feeling to be alive," said Alonso, who finished second in Sunday's championship race behind McLaren's Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari's Felipe Massa. Alonso is the only driver to win the World Championship this year, and he will be joined by his McLaren teammate and teammate Alonso in Saturday's race at Silverstone. Both drivers have been racing since the end of last year's season, with Alonso leading the Drivers' Championship standings by more than a tenth of a second, while the Spaniard was third in points with McLaren, Ferrari, Renault and Force India. Ferrari and McLaren were the other teams to make up the gap, but Alonso's victory was the most emphatic of his season so far. He is now in pole position for his second career grand prix in Germany, where he is expected to lead the championship by a wide margin. McLaren and Williams have already clinched their respective titles in Britain, Britain and Colombia, respectively, ahead of Germany and Britain. But Alonso will have to wait until the weekend to claim his first World Title in a series that has seen a lot of controversy over the past few years. In Canada, McLaren has been relegated to third place for a fifth consecutive year and the German team has yet to qualify for Indianapolis. Williams, meanwhile, is in fourth place with a total of five races remaining in its schedule, including three races in Canada and one in Colombia. It is also the second consecutive season in which the Championship leader has not been able to reach the podium, after Alonso was eliminated from the race in Mexico last month. Fernando Alvarado, the reigning world champion, has also been unable to get into the driver's seat due to a broken collarbone, which has forced him to retire from racing after a season-ending collision with teammate Kasey Kahne on the opening lap of Canada's Canadian grand Prix. That left Alonso with just one lap to go in qualifying and just a handful of laps to race before he was forced to pull out of qualifying. After qualifying in fifth place, Alonso had to settle for sixth place in British GP qualifying, a position he has held since returning from a two-year doping ban. On the back of that, he scored his fourth victory in as many races as he can manage in 2017, when he finished fourth in Malaysia. His second win in four races this season came at the Australian GP, also in Australia, in an event that saw him win his third championship in three seasons. And his fifth in five years in F1, as well as his sixth in England, was a runner-up finish in Indianapolis in 2015. With Alonso now back in action, it is up to Alonso to decide whether or not he wants to return to the track next year. If he decides to stay at home and focus on his racing career, there is a chance that he could make it back to racing again in 2018. For now, though, his focus is on winning races. Last year he won two races at Indianapolis, finishing in second place. This year his best season has come in third position in both races, although he still has a few races left in him. So far he's had a good run of form in Indy and is looking forward to his final season as a professional driver. However, that doesn't necessarily mean he'll be back on track to compete for another championship title. As a result, this weekend's races will not be the same as last season's. Expectations are high for Alonso: "I'm not going to give up," he said, "but I'm sure I'll do my best." Alonso also has his sights set on a fourth title, having already claimed the world title for McLaren in 2016. Despite his lack of experience in front of him, Monaco's Alonso looks set to have a strong season ahead, despite the fact that his team-mates are struggling to find a way to keep up with the top-tier drivers.

It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight "Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved," said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. "But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on." The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. "The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap," said the Finn. "The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend." Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. "I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany," said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. "I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone." Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim. "

The Swedish economist was the first Nobel laureate to receive the prize. Oliver Williamson, co-prizewinner of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (RSS) and professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, received the award for his work on economic institutions of capitalism. "The Economic Institutions of Capitalism" (ERI) "is the most important work in the history of economic science in Sweden," said Williamson in a statement released by the RSS on Tuesday. Williamson said he was "deeply saddened" to learn that his compatriot had died of a heart attack just a few days before the awards ceremony. In 1968, the Swedish central bank, which has since become the world's largest central banking institution, announced that it would no longer be able to finance the country's central banks, but would instead be forced to do so through the use of state-run financial institutions. Nobel laureates have long been associated with the Stockholm-based monetary system, and Williamson was one of its most well-known figures. He was also a leading figure in economic theory and economics, particularly in Germany and Israel, where he worked as an industrialist for many years. But he died in 1975 after a long illness that left him unable to work for more than a year and a half. His death was followed by a series of strokes, including a stroke that killed him in 1969. Author and Nobel Laureate Elina Mueller, who was born in Stockholm in 1896, has been credited with helping to create the modern financial system that has become known as the "Swedish economy." In 1975, Williamson received a Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his research on the economics of capital formation and the role of monetary policy in creating the system of exchange rates between the two countries. It is the second time that Williamson has won an award, after the German economist Herta Mueller. Both men have also been recognized for their contributions to the development of financial markets in their respective countries, as well as their work as economists and political scientists. They have been awarded a total of 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros) each year since the end of World War II. Their work has also earned them the distinction of being among the best economists of all time, with Williamson being the only one who has ever received an honorary doctorate from the university of Stockholm. On the other hand, they have both been honored with two Nobel Prizes: the American and Israeli Nobel prizes for literature, economics and social sciences, respectively. One of Williamson's most famous achievements is his Nobel-winning work, "Eri," in which he argues that the economic system is "the most efficient in history." The other prize is awarded to economists who have made a contribution to society through their research, such as his wife, Carol Greider, or his daughter, Ada Yonath. This year's prize was presented to Williamson for "an outstanding work of literature and thought." Williamson also won a second prize, this time for a book on economics that he wrote about his experiences as a student at a university in Tel Aviv, Israel. As a graduate student, he also wrote an article for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz about the impact of globalization on his life and his family's financial situation in Israel: "It's a great honor for me to be awarded this award. I'm very proud of my work and I hope that I can contribute to a better future for my family and my country," Williamson wrote in his book "A Nobel for Peace," which was published in 1973. Another prize won by Williamson is a prize for research into the effects of climate change on people's health and how it affects their physical and mental health. A Nobel award is given annually to an individual or group of people who are suffering from a health condition or illness, often referred to as "palliative care" or "dementia." "I'm honored to have won this prize," he said, adding that "it's an honor to give back to my wife and children who helped shape the future of our country." "
,"Reference text": " US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how "economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization." Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her "analysis of economic governance," especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt "great surprise and appreciation" and was "in shock" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. "He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict," the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last "Nobel prize" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his "extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples." jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds " 

},{"Generated text": " Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Airport A new airport in the German city of Brandenburg is being built by Malaysian businessman Colin Au. The project is part of a $120 million project to develop the tropical islands off the coast of the Caribbean. It will be the first of its kind in Germany, and it is expected to be completed by the end of 2003. A spokesman for the airport said the project was being developed with the help of German businessman Steffen Kammrath. "The project has been in development since 1990," he said in an interview with German news agency dpa. In the 1990s, the company was set up as a private company, with a focus on developing the islands. Since then, it has developed into a commercial airport, which has become one of Europe's largest airports and is the world's busiest in terms of passenger traffic. However, there have been some delays and cancellations due to poor weather conditions. During the recession, a number of airports in Europe and Asia were shut down, as well as at the beginning of 2005, when the island of Laguna was declared uninhabitable. This was followed by a series of delays in 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2008. At the same time, delays were reported at other airports across Europe, including the Berlin-Berlin International airport and the Brussels-Stuttgart airport. There were also delays at some other European airports, such as the Frankfurt-Belgium International Airport (BELG), which was closed in 2003 for lack of funds. Another delay occurred in 2005 when it was announced that the new terminal would not be operational for two years. Then, in 2006, an emergency order was issued for a total of 15 million euros ($15 million). The delay was blamed on the fact that there was a shortage of skilled workers and that it had been difficult to find suitable staff to fill the positions. But the government of Germany said it would continue to look into the matter, adding that "it will take some time" before it could be decided whether or not to reopen the terminal. 'We are not going to let this happen again,' said a government spokesman, who declined to give a specific time frame, but added that a decision would be made in a matter of weeks. “We have to make sure that we have a plan in place,” the spokesman said, referring to the decision to close the Tropical Island terminal in order to save money. He said there were no plans to open a second terminal at any other international airport or to build a new one in other countries. That would require a lot of time and effort, he added, because the current terminal is too small to accommodate all the people who want to use it. So, for now, this is a project that will only take a few months to complete, according to a spokesman from the Federal Ministry of Economy and Trade and Industry (FME). "It's a very big project and we are looking at it very carefully," said FME spokesman Stefan Schulz. For the most part, however, things are going well. FEMALE FLIGHTS The new tropical island terminal was built in 1990 and has since become a major tourist attraction, attracting tourists from all over the globe. Last year, more than 100,000 tourists visited the area. More than 1,500 people were on board the plane, many of them from Europe. Some of those tourists were able to stay for several days, while others were unable to get to their destination because they were too sick to fly. They were not allowed to return to Germany for medical reasons. One of these reasons was that they didn't have enough money to cover the costs of running the facility. And that was the main reason why they had to cancel the contract. Now, they have decided to shut it down and move it to another terminal, where they are planning on opening a third terminal later this year. What's next? "We will see what happens with this project. We are very happy to see the results of this pilot program," the minister said. If the pilot is successful, then it will open up a whole new market for tourism and tourism. "
,"Reference text": " The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his "Tropical Islands" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet "We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management," ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. "This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there." Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.

The Bavarian club have lost three of their last four matches, including a 3-1 defeat to Hoffenerheim in Friday night's Bundesliga clash. On Friday, the German side fell to Leverkusen, 2-2, in their first match in what was supposed to be a three-match winless run in all competitions. "It's been a difficult few weeks for us," said Bayern commercial manager Ralf Rangnick, referring to the club's relegation from the top flight last season. But it's not just the coach who has had to cope with the pressure. He's also having to deal with a lot of criticism from his own fans, who have been critical of the way he's handled the team in recent weeks. In the first half of Friday's match, Hoffengheim were outclassed by the likes of Hoffa and Bielefeld, while the second half was even worse for the Bavarians. After the break, Bayern took the lead for good, but the home side were unable to hold on to a point. Hoffeneheim, however, were able to pull off the upset, scoring a late equalizer to put the match out of reach for a second time in as many matches. It was a result that will be remembered by many as a turning point in a season that has seen a number of high-profile players leave the sport in search of greener pastures. Last season, Munich were the only team to win the league title, and they have since been relegated. This year, they will have to make up for that by winning the Champions League, which they lost to Bayern last year. They will also be looking to improve on their recent form, having lost their opening two matches in Germany and losing their final three games in Europe. A win over Hoffeheim would be Munich's first win in three matches since the end of December, when they were knocked out by a Bayer team that had beaten them in two of its last three league games. However, it will not be the last time that Bayern have won a Bundesliga game, as they are currently sitting on top of a four-game winning streak. At the same time, there is the possibility that they could be relegated again this season if they don't make the playoffs. That's the main reason why Bayern are so desperate to get back into the title race. If they can't do that, then they need to find a way to avoid relegation. And that's why they've been playing so well for so long. There's no reason to think that this is going to happen again, because it won't be easy for them to do it again. So far, so good. We've had a couple of good results in our first two games and we're looking forward to this one. I think we'll have a good chance of getting back to that level again next season when we go to Germany. For now, though, we've got to wait and see what happens. What do you think will happen next year? We'll see how it all plays out. How many games do we have left to play? How long will it take for Bayern to reach the next level? It's a long time before they get a chance to prove themselves in this league. As a coach, you can always count on your players to step up and play for you. You can never have too much success if you're not playing for your team. Even if the players are playing well, that doesn't mean they'll be happy with what you've done so far. When it comes down to it, I'm not sure how long it'll take to convince the fans to give up on the idea of being a Bayern coach. Do you have any doubts about the quality of Bayern's players? If so, what will they do with them? Do they play well enough? Are they good enough at all? Should they be better than the other teams? Of course not, of course they should be. Only time will tell. "
,"Reference text": " Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. "I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players," Klinsmann told DPA news agency. "They can be proud of that." Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. "There's nothing negative about it," Klinsmann said. "He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet." Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. "The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim," Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. "Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics," Hoeness said. "And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim." But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich.

The results are expected to be announced on Friday. Zimbabwe's election has been delayed by several days due to the disputed results. Opposition candidate Emmerson Mnangagwa won the election on Thursday, beating incumbent Robert Mugabe by a wide margin. ZANU-PF leader Nelson Chamisa, who is running for the presidency of Zimbabwe, was the main opposition candidate in the first round of voting. However, the electoral commission, which is run by the Zimbabwean opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC-Z), said it had not yet decided on the winner. "We are still waiting for a final result," ZEC chairwoman Tonderai Bosha told DW in Harare, adding that it was too early to say whether the outcome would be decided by Zimbabweans. In a statement released on Twitter, Zimbabwe’s president said he was "deeply disappointed" with the result and that he would not accept a second round result. He also said that the elections were being held "in the interests of democracy and the rule of law." Zimbabwe has a long list of political parties, including the ruling Zimbabwe People's Democratic Party (HDP), the opposition party of former president Robert Zvulunziza, as well as a number of other opposition parties. DW's Elmar Brok, a member of parliament for Zimbabwe and a former head of state at the United States' embassy in London, wrote that Zimbabwe was in a "very difficult situation" because of a lack of transparency and accountability in its electoral system. It was also unclear whether Zimbabwe would allow the president to run for re-election in 2018, he said. US State Department Chairwoman Priscilla Chigumba said the US had "grave concerns" about the situation in Zimbabwe. She added that "we are very concerned that there is a lot of misinformation out there and we are not going to allow this to happen." The US has also expressed concern about a possible conflict of interest between the two sides. nm,jm/rc (Reuters, AFP) and Columbus Mavhunga, an EU-based expert on international affairs, said in an email that US officials were "extremely concerned" over the "serious and serious" allegations made against the former leader in 2002 and 2002, when he led Zimbabwe into a bloody civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people and left millions of others without a voice and without hope for political change. Both men have denied any involvement in any political or economic change since the war ended in 1980, but both men deny that they were involved in anything that could have led to a political crisis in their country, according to US state department officials, and have said they have no reason to believe that their involvement would lead to any kind of change in government. They also deny the allegations of corruption, saying they do not have evidence to support the accusations made by US President Barack Obama or US Secretary of State John Kerry, in which they are alleged to have been made public by former US ambassador to Zimbabwe in 2008, to which US Vice President Mike Pompeo was accused of providing false information. At the same time, US embassy officials said there was no evidence of any collusion between US and Zimbabwe during the 2008 election, despite US allegations that both sides had conspired to rig the vote. According to USA Today, "US officials have not been able to confirm or deny any information provided to them by our intelligence agencies." "The US is deeply concerned about this," US national security adviser Michael McFaul said, referring to "the fact that this election was conducted without the knowledge of US intelligence officials." US Ambassador to Zanzibar Christopher Wylie said his country is in "a very difficult position" and urged Zimbabwe to find a solution to its current political problems, pointing out that many of its problems stem from the 1980s and 1990s when the state security chief, then known as "Mugabe," was killed by an alleged coup attempt during a failed attempt to overthrow the then-dictatorship regime. His successor, former vice president Nelson Mandela, has since been removed from his post as president and is currently serving a 10-year term in prison for corruption and abuse of power. "

Calling the results "fake," opposition candidate Nelson Chamisa has vowed to launch a legal challenge. The electoral commission announced the presidential election results province by province, declaring ZANU-PF candidate Emmerson Mnangagwa president by the closest of margins. The announcement came after clashes between opposition protesters and soldiers in Harare left at least six people dead on Thursday. The unrest marred what had been billed as an important milestone in Zimbabwe's efforts to return to democracy following 37 years of repression under longtime leader Robert Mugabe. In a press conference on Friday, Mnangagwa said there would be an independent investigation into the post-election violence. He also called on the opposition to help him bring about peace and unity, declaring that he would serve all Zimbabweans, including those who didn't vote for him. "Here was a celebration of Zimbabwean democracy, a festival of unfettered freedom. With the eyes of the world on us we delivered a free, fair and credible election," he said. Opposition challenges results Mnangagwa, 75, won 50.8 percent of the vote, ahead of Nelson Chamisa of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party with 44.3 percent, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) said. Chamisa, 40, has dismissed what he called "unverified fake results," and said the MDC planned to challenge the outcome of the "rigged" election. But the ZANU-PF youth spokesman, Tonderai Bosha, told DW on Friday that the opposition would not accept an election loss. "The opposition is saying we rigged the election. That has been the narrative during the campaigns, before the elections," Tonderai said in Harare. "What they only wanted was victory on their side. If it's victory on ZANU-PF side, it's not victory." After the first four of 10 provincial results, Chamisa's MDC had a lead of about 50,000 votes over the ruling ZANU-PF. But after the fifth province was announced, the lead had switched to Mnangagwa. He quickly took to Twitter to hail what he called "a new beginning." To become president, a candidate has to take more than 50 percent of the vote. Chamisa did well in urban areas, but Mnangagwa outperformed him among rural voters. Chamisa said police raided opposition headquarters in Harare and seized computers. The search warrant indicated they were looking for unlicensed firearms, grenades and stones. Police said 16 people in the offices were arrested. Riot police later briefly disrupted a press conference where Chamisa was scheduled to speak. The opposition indicated it would challenge the result in the courts. "What they have been trying to do of late is to play around," Chamisa told reporters hours before the final results. "That is rigging, that is manipulation, trying to bastardize the result, and that we will not allow." Other results announced by the electoral commission: The ruling ZANU-PF party won 144 of the 210 seats in parliament — a two-thirds majority which enables it to change the constitution. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) took at least 61 seats. Observers highlight flaws Elmar Brok, chief observer for the EU's election monitor mission in Zimbabwe, told DW that the vote was marred by a "lot of shortcomings in favor of the ruling party," including through "financing, state media, intimidation, especially in the countryside." Late Friday, the US said it was reviewing the election results. "The United States will continue to review the data collected by its own observation teams, by international observation missions and by local observers to make a complete assessment of the overall election," the State Department said in a statement. It urged all sides to act peacefully and called on the political parties "to show magnanimity in victory and graciousness in defeat."

It has a lot in common with the French language, but it is also very similar to the German way of speaking. For example, German-speaking people are more likely to speak German than French, and this is especially true in the case of German speaking people. In the past, Germans have been able to express themselves in a variety of languages, including French and German. However, in Germany, the language has become more and more important than in other languages. This is particularly true for German people, who have always been interested in languages other than those of the native tongue. German is a language that can be translated into many different languages and cultures, as well as in many other countries. But in German the word "German" means "language." In other words, it means something different than what is spoken in English. The word 'language' is used to describe the way German speakers speak, which is to say, "Language is not the same as English." It is therefore not only German that speaks German but also German in general, especially when it comes to language and culture. So, for instance, if you are a German speaker, you have to be fluent in both German and French. You can also read German when you speak to a foreign speaker. And you can even use German as a verb. I don't think that's a bad thing, I think it's just a matter of time before you realize that you're talking to someone who doesn't understand your language well enough to understand what they're saying. That's what I mean when I say that I'm trying to explain to my German friends why I can't speak English and how to translate it into German for them. They have a different language than I do, so they can understand my language better. Also, they have different ways of communicating with each other. One of them is through the use of a translator. Another is by using an app that allows you to communicate directly with one another. Finally, there is the option of using the app to send a text message to one of your friends in order to get the message out to them directly. There are also a number of other options, such as sending text messages to your friend, or using a mobile phone. These are all options that are available to anyone who wants to talk to you directly, without having to sign up for any kind of formal communication. All of these options are open to interpretation and will be available on the internet at any time, of course, except for the most basic ones. Read more: How to make a phone call with your phone?

I'd like to hear from you about the phone number you've given me and I'll let you know what's going on in your life. Let's see how you feel about it, then we'll see what you think of it. What are your thoughts on it? Do you agree with me on this? Is it a good idea to use this app? Would you use it for anything else? If so, would you recommend it to me? Of course not, because it would be a great idea for me to give you a better idea of what to expect from a person who has never used a smartphone before. Or would it be better to just use a smart phone or tablet? No, not really, just to test it out and see if it works well for you? Or is it just that simple? Well, yes and no, that is what we're doing right now is really good for us to try and improve our communication and communication skills. We're working on that, obviously, to improve communication with people who are using smartphones and tablets. Then we can do this with our phones and other devices that work with them and use them to help us communicate with other people and things like that. Now that we've got a new phone, we have some options. "

Lahkkdar Brahimi, deputy foreign minister of Syria, said on Friday that the ceasefire would not be extended beyond 24.01.2014. "We are calling for the cessation of hostilities," he told reporters at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. The ceasefire, which has been in place since the beginning of the conflict, was called off by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who said it was "unacceptable" that a ceasefire had been declared. He also called on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to hold a special meeting to discuss the truce. A UNSC spokesman, Ziad Malki, told the press conference that "the ceasefire is not a guarantee of peace." "The ceasefire does not guarantee that there will be a cease-fire," the UN spokesman said, adding that he did not know of any agreement on a truce between the SNC and the opposition. However, he said there was a "very good chance" of a deal being reached by the Syrian government and its allies, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Turkey. In the absence of an agreement, the two sides have been unable to reach a consensus on how to resolve the crisis. Both sides, however, have said they are willing to work with the other side to find a way to end the stalemate. At the same time, they have also said that they do not want to see a cessation in hostilities. On the one hand, there is the issue of Assad's ability to control the regime, but there are also other issues that need to be resolved. There is also the question of how long it will take for Syria's government to agree to a peace deal. That is, if it can be reached in time. It is important to remember that this is a transitional period, not an interim period. And that is why we have to wait until the end of this year. We are not going to give up on this. This is because we will not allow this to happen in a few months. I think we are ready to move on to something else." The Geneva peace talks are scheduled to resume on Saturday, with talks set to take place in Switzerland and Geneva starting on Sunday. Talks are expected to last for at least two weeks. Syrian opposition leaders are hoping for a resumption of talks. They are hopeful that talks will resume soon after the Geneva talks, in which they hope to have a breakthrough in negotiations. Meanwhile, a number of European countries have expressed concern about the lack of progress in talks with Damascus. Some of them have already expressed their concern over a possible truce, while others have voiced their support for Assad and his regime. Others are concerned that it could lead to an escalation of violence. While the talks have so far failed to produce any breakthroughs, it is clear that Syria is in need of some kind of political settlement. As a result, more and more people are being forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in other countries, such as the US, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Italy and even the European Union. These are the countries that have the most to lose in terms of their own political and economic interests. One of those countries is Turkey - the only country that has not yet signed an international peace accords with Syria. Another is Jordan - a country with a population of around 1.5 million. But it has yet to sign one of its own. According to UN special rapporteur on Syria Lourdes Mekdad, Syria has a long list of grievances with its government. Most of these are related to its military and security forces, and he is particularly concerned about how the government is handling the situation in Aleppo, where the rebels are fighting for their lives. His concern is that Assad will continue to use chemical weapons against civilians in order to maintain his grip on power and influence over his own people. Speaking to reporters in Zurich, Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Abdel-Rahman said: "I am very worried about what is going on in this country and I am not sure what the future holds for us." He added that his country would be better off without Assad if he were to step down from his post as Syrian president. “It is very difficult for me to say that I don’t know what to do with myself,” Abdel Rahman said.

,"Reference text": " Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. "Good afternoon," Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, "or good evening, I don't know." At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: "Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room." What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. "We are here to start the negotiations," he told waiting journalists, "but we found that the other party did not want to come." Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: "Forming a transitional body is our major priority," leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. "Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?," she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. "Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. "We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be," he said. "But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape." He added: "The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that." After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: "So wish us luck!" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. "We don't want this man to be in " 

},{"Generated text": " EU warns of 'grave consequences' of Italy's migrant crisis The European Union has warned Italy of grave consequences for its handling of the crisis in the Mediterranean. The EU's High Commissioner for Migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, warned on Thursday that Italy was "gravely concerned" about the situation in Libya. "We are deeply concerned," he said in a statement, adding that "it is a grave and grave danger" for Italy to continue to face the consequences of its actions. Italy is the only EU country that has so far managed to cope with the influx of migrants from Libya, according to the United Nations. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, who has been in Rome for more than a year, said he was concerned about "serious consequences" if Italy fails to act quickly to stem the flow of people fleeing the country's civil war. He also warned that the EU would not be able to take action against Italy if it failed to do so by the end of this year. EU migration commissioner for migration, Filippo Grandi, told a news conference in Brussels that Italian officials were "very concerned." "Italy is very concerned that we are going to have to deal with this crisis," said the Italian high commissioner, speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of EU leaders in Italy. But he added that it would be "a grave mistake" to not act immediately, because Italy has a long way to go before it is ready to accept all migrants, including those fleeing war-ravaged countries such as Libya and Eritrea, as well as those seeking asylum in other EU member states. In the past, Italy had been the most restrictive country in Europe in terms of accepting migrants and refugees, but now it has become the least restrictive. It is not only Italy that is worried about its own situation but also that of other European countries, which are also facing the same situation. At the beginning of 2014, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) in Ventimiglia, in northern Italy, was set up to handle the issue. Since then, however, there have been a number of incidents in which migrants have sought asylum, and in some cases, they have even been denied entry. This has led to a lot of concern among EU officials. Last week, Italian Foreign Minister Pavlo Pavlovic told the press conference that his country was in "deep trouble" because of what he described as the "unprecedented situation" of migrant flows in and out of Europe. However, he also said that he did not see any reason why Italy should not do more to help those who are fleeing conflict and persecution in their home countries. That is why he has called for an end to EU-wide "zero tolerance" policies on migration. Avramsopoulos said Italy would continue its efforts to tackle the problem of illegal migration in order to prevent it from spreading across the continent. On the other hand, Greece and Italy have also stepped up their efforts in recent years to try to stop the spread of refugees into their own country. As a result, many of them have fled their homes and are now seeking refuge in countries like Italy and Greece. There is also a growing concern that some of these migrants will be forced to return to their countries of origin if they are not allowed to stay for long periods of time. According to Italian media reports, this could lead to an increase in deaths and injuries among asylum-seekers, particularly among young people and people of color. And it could also be the case that migrants are becoming more and more desperate as they seek to reach their destination. For example, a recent report in The New York Times said: "In the last few days, we have seen a surge in cases of unaccompanied minors coming to Italy from countries that have not yet received their visas." The report also pointed out that in many cases they had already applied for asylum and that this was not an easy situation to overcome. Some of those cases have resulted in people being sent back to countries where they were unable to obtain visas or to other countries to apply for refugee status. Others have come from places like Greece or Italy which have refused to allow them to enter the bloc. "
,"Reference text": " Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that "Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others." The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that "Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full." The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, "What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy." The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the "deadliest" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area. "

The tournament will be hosted by Germany's largest city, Berlin. Berlin is the host city for this year's tournament. Germany is hosting the tournament as part of the FIFA Women’s World Cups (FWDW). The German capital, which is home to more than 100,000 people, is gearing up for its biggest sporting event yet, with the opening ceremony set to take place at the Brandenburg Gate. Organizers are hoping for a warm welcome from the fans, who are expected to cheer on their favorite teams as they enter the stadium. However, there is a catch: the venue is not the same as in previous years. There is no guarantee that the stadiums will hold as many women as there are men. That's because the venues are so small, they don't have a lot of room for women. So, the organizers are going to have to wait until the last minute to make sure that they have everything they need in order to get the best possible experience. And that's not to say that there won't be a few surprises. In the past, Germany has hosted many international sporting events, but this time around, it has been a different story. For example, in Germany, we had the chance to watch the 2014 World Championships on television. We were also able to catch a glimpse of Germany in action, as well as a couple of other countries. It was a very special moment for Germany because it was the only country that had ever hosted the event. This year, however, things have changed. Now we have the opportunity to see Germany play host to the competition, and we are all looking forward to seeing what happens next year. I am very excited about this opportunity because I have always wanted to go to Germany and I can't wait to do it again. But I also want to show that Germany can be proud of what we've done so far and that we can make the most of it. "I am so happy to be here," I said, adding that I was also very happy with my team's performance and the way they performed in their final match against France.   "We are very proud that our team played so well in this competition," said I, "and we will continue to work hard to achieve our goal of being the greatest team in world soccer."  I'm also really happy about the fact that this tournament is being held in Berlin, so I think it's a great opportunity for us to showcase our talents in front of our fans and give them something to think about in a big way. After all, this is our first tournament in our country and it is only the second time we'll be hosting a major international event in which we get to experience the atmosphere of such a huge competition. What do you think? What are your thoughts on this event? Do you have any thoughts? I'd love to hear from you?  For me, personally, I would like to thank you very much for your support and for all the hard work you've put in to making this happen. You have been very kind and generous in helping us achieve this goal. Your support is very important to me and to this day I feel very grateful that you are here with me. Thank you for being here and helping me out so much, especially as I've been working so hard for so many years and have become so close to my family and friends. All I want is for you to come and see me again and be there with them and help them achieve their dream of becoming a world champion and winning a trophy. As a result, you can see that many people have come here to enjoy the experience of participating in FIFA and being a member of a team that has already achieved this great achievement. Most of us are happy that FIFA has come to a conclusion that it can do something that is really important for them to win a prize for their country. Let's see how it goes from here on out "

Associated Press news agency (AP, Reuters, AFP) reported on Tuesday that the death toll from the car accident, which killed two people, had risen to at least 25. The accident occurred in the Champ de Mars district of the port city of Haiti, where the Carnival festivities kicked off on Carnival day. Police said they were searching for the suspects, but did not immediately know if they had been killed. Haiti's president Michel Martelly said on Twitter that he was "deeply saddened" by the accident. "I am deeply saddened by this tragedy," he said, adding that it was the first time he had personally witnessed such a tragedy in his life. He also called on the international community to help in any way they could. In a statement posted on his Twitter account, the president said: "We are very sorry to hear of this terrible tragedy. We are so sorry that you have to live with it." He added that his government would continue to work with the police to ensure the safety of all those injured. pfd/rc (Reuters, EPA, AP) and other media outlets reported that a number of police officers had also been injured during the crash, with one of them seriously injuring a police officer and another seriously injured, according to local media reports. A police spokesman said the officer was being treated at a hospital for minor injuries and was expected to be released later Tuesday evening. Pfd (AFP, REUTERS, Agencies) The crash occurred at the end of Carnival, a popular tourist destination in northern Haiti known for its carnival games. It is not clear how many people were injured or how long it took for authorities to reach the victims, who are believed to have been in critical condition for several days. At least one person was taken to a nearby hospital with serious injuries, while another was treated for a minor head injury and released on a stretcher after being hit by a vehicle, officials said. During the incident, police said a man was killed when he tried to run away from a group of people in front of a bus carrying Carnival-related items, as well as a woman and a child with a broken leg. According to the AP, there were no reports of any other injuries or fatalities. On Tuesday, authorities said that two other people had died, including the driver of an ambulance who was shot and critically injured by an unknown assailant while trying to flee the scene, and that police were still searching the area for other injured people. Officials have not said whether the two deaths were linked to an accident or whether they are related to each other, although they have both been reported as being linked in recent days by police and the media. They are not yet known if there are any suspects in connection with Tuesday's crash or if the vehicle was deliberately driven into a crowd of mourners and revelers who had gathered outside the bus stop, in an apparent attempt to prevent it from going into the city's main thoroughfare. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, however, for what caused the deadly crash. Authorities have said it is unclear whether there was a connection between the attack and an attack on security forces or a separate incident in which a policeman was injured and killed by another person. However, it appears that there may be other factors at play, such as the fact that authorities are still investigating the circumstances of Monday's accident and whether or not a suspect has been arrested and charged with attempted murder. Earlier this week, Haitian authorities announced that they would launch an investigation into what they believe was an attempted assassination attempt on them by armed men. Investigators have yet to determine the exact nature of that attack, though they suspect it may have involved an armed robbery or an act of terrorism. Some reports have suggested that an attempt was made to cover up the crime, saying the attacker was carrying out a "terrorist act." The investigation is being conducted by investigators from France and Belgium. "

Some of the victims were electrocuted instantly, while others jumped off the float, causing panic among the revelers who lined the street. Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities. There was some confusion about the number of fatalities, with the Associated Press putting it at 20, and AFP later reported that only around 10 had died.

The North Korean leader is expected to make his first public appearance since the end of the Korean War in November 2010. In an interview with the South Korean news agency Yonhap, the two men said they would meet at Pyongyang's Yeonpyeongdo military base. "We are going to see what happens in the next few days," they said, adding that they had already discussed the possibility of holding a summit with Kim Jong Un. North Korea is believed to have agreed to hold talks with South Korea and the United Nations in February, but they have yet to agree on a date. According to a statement released by the North's People's Armed Forces (PAF), the country's armed forces have been preparing for a possible summit since early 2010, and that the talks were to be held in early May. However, it is unclear whether the meeting will take place at the same time as the planned summit. On the other hand, there has been speculation that Pyongyang may be planning a military summit in late May or early June. It is also believed that a meeting between Kim and Kim could be scheduled for early next year. Kim has already said that he will hold a press conference in Beijing in mid-May to discuss the summit, which is widely seen as a chance for Pyongyang to reach an agreement on the terms of its nuclear and missile tests. Pyongyang has not yet agreed on an exact date, although it has indicated that it would hold an early meeting in April. But Kim is likely to sign a deal before then, according to Kim's government. He has also said he is willing to talk to the UN about the nuclear test, as well as other issues, such as how to deal with a nuclear-armed North. China, meanwhile, has expressed concern over the lack of progress on its own nuclear weapons program. Last year, China's Foreign Trade Bank of China (FTCB) said it was "very concerned" that North Koreans were planning to launch a missile attack on Seoul's Musudan air base in response to an attack by US forces on April 11. Japan's Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor of international relations at Tokyo's Waseda University, told DW: "It is very worrying that there is a lot of uncertainty about what is going on in this country. We are very concerned about how the regime is handling the situation and how it will respond to it." The US and China have also expressed their concern, saying they are "not ready to give up their support" for the missile test. They also believe that China will not be able to provide any aid to Pyongyang if the test is carried out in accordance with international law. So far, however, Beijing has so far refused to do so, despite repeated requests from the US, Japan and other countries to help Pyongyang avoid sanctions. This has led to tensions between Beijing and Pyongyang, with Beijing threatening to cut off trade with Seoul if Pyongyang does not comply with its demands for nuclear disarmament. As a result, Seoul has imposed sanctions on Pyongyang in order to prevent it from launching a new missile program in retaliation for its alleged nuclear tests in March and April, while Washington has threatened to impose economic sanctions against Pyongyang for failing to halt the launch of a ballistic missile. Meanwhile, Tokyo and Beijing are also considering a moratorium on military exercises with Pyongyang until May 7, in an effort to ease tensions. If the sanctions are not lifted, Pyongyang will have to decide whether or not it wants to continue to use its military force to defend itself against a US missile launch. That would be a major setback for Beijing, who has a long history of supporting Pyongyang and has long been critical of Pyongyang. For the past few years, Chinese President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing is prepared to cooperate with China in its efforts to pressure Pyongyang into giving up its weapons of mass destruction. At the beginning of this month, Xi said the Chinese government would also cooperate in a bid to persuade Pyongyang not to violate its obligations under international treaties. Xi also called on Beijing to step in to protect the interests of Chinese citizens, including those who are currently living in exile in China. "
,"Reference text": " Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to "minister of the People's Armed Forces" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. "For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time," Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. "Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders." Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' "China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea," said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. "Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea," he said. "Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam." Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing "

US officials are expected to hold a press conference in Mexico City later this week to discuss the arrest of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman. The two men were arrested last Friday in the southern state of Chiudad Juarez, close to the border with Sinaloa, where US President Donald Trump is due to arrive later on Friday. Mexican officials have said they will hold an emergency meeting with US Secretary of Homeland Security John "John Kelly" on Thursday. In a statement, Kelly said the US was "deeply concerned" about the arrests of the suspected drug kingpin. "We are deeply concerned," he said, adding that "it is our responsibility as a country to protect our citizens and our national security." Mexico's security commissioner, Oscar Alberto Aparicio, told reporters that he had been in contact with the Mexican president since January, when he received a tip that the man was planning to flee the country in a Black Hawk helicopter. He said he was told to stay away from the area because he feared for his life. Mexico has been on high alert since the start of this year, with a number of major terror attacks in recent months. Last Friday, Mexican authorities shot and killed a man suspected of being the ringleader of a drug trafficking ring that has killed more than 1,000 people over the past two years. On Thursday, US authorities announced that they had arrested a suspect in connection with an investigation into the drug ring's activities in Chihuahua state. A spokesman for the department of interior, which is responsible for policing the region, said it was cooperating with federal authorities in their efforts to crack down on the organization. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)In a separate incident, a US military helicopter was shot down near the town of Las Varas in southern Mexico, killing one man and injuring two others. It was the second such incident in less than a month, according to Mexican security officials, and the first occurred in January last year. At the end of May, the helicopter crashed into a field near a military base in northern Chiapas state and was later found to have been shot dead by a Mexican police officer, who was not identified by the Associated Press as the suspect, but was believed to be in possession of an AK-47 assault rifle and other weapons, officials said. Officials said that a second helicopter had also been used to shoot down the vehicle. They said there were no indications that any other vehicles were involved, although the plane was carrying a large amount of ammunition and a small quantity of cash. According to a security official, there was no evidence of any weapons being used against the alleged drug trafficker during the investigation. However, security experts have warned that it could take months for authorities to determine whether the operation was being carried out in full compliance with international law and international humanitarian law. If it is, they say, it would be a "significant setback" for security forces and their ability to carry out their mission. Read more: How to stop the flow of drugs into Mexico and how to prevent it from spreading to other Latin American countries The Mexican government is also preparing for a possible crackdown on drug traffickers in its own country, following a series of deadly attacks last month that killed dozens of people and injured hundreds of thousands of others in border areas. IPj (AFP, AP, news agency) and an AFP reporter were among those who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity in order to preserve the public's view of what was happening at the time of their meeting, saying that authorities were still trying to establish the exact location of "the operation" and "what was going on" at a meeting of top US and Mexican leaders in Hamburg on May 19 and 20. But the government has yet to confirm whether or not it will be able to arrest the suspects, as it has done in previous attempts to extradite them to US custody in other countries, including in El Paso, Texas.

Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a "cowardly" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago.

"Shared responsibility" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels.

},{"Generated text": " Nigeria: Boko Haram kills at least 10, injures dozens in northeast Borno state A Nigerian lawyer has said that the Islamist militant group that has claimed responsibility for the deadly attacks in the northeast has killed more than 10 people. Femi Falana said on Wednesday that he had received a call from the Nigerian army's 7th Division, which has been fighting the group since August. "We have received information that a number of people have been killed and injured," he told reporters in Maiduguri, northeast Nigeria's largest city. The army said it was investigating the death toll, adding that it had not yet received any information on the exact nature of the attacks. According to the lawyer, the attack was carried out by a group of Islamist militants who claimed to be the victims of an attack on a police station in September. Police had earlier said the attackers were carrying out a series of attacks on police stations and a military base in Borne state. On October 15, police said they had arrested a man suspected of being a member of a terrorist organization and that his body had been taken to a detention center in Cameroon, where he was being held for questioning. He has since been released on bail and is expected to return to Nigeria on September 15. Falanas said there were no reports of any other attacks, but that there was a "significant increase in attacks" since the beginning of September, when the military launched a major offensive against the militants. In a statement, Borna state's military said its forces had repelled several attacks by the Islamists, including a suicide bomber who blew himself up in clashes with security forces. It added that more attacks were planned for this week, with the aim of stopping the spread of Islamic extremist ideology across the country. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa) - type of footer The attack came after a week of heavy fighting between the two sides, in which a total of 12 people were killed. Some of those killed were soldiers from Cameroon and Chad, while others were civilians from Niger, Chad and Cameroon. Both countries have suffered heavy losses in fighting over the past two weeks, according to military spokesman Ibrahim Idris. Last month, a Nigerian soldier was killed in a clash with a suspected Islamist group in northern Nigeria, leading to an exchange of fire between troops and the insurgents, he said. At the same time, Niger's army has also been accused of supporting the jihadist group, whose fighters are believed to have killed thousands of civilians in their fight against government forces in recent months, as well as soldiers and police in other parts of Nigeria. As a result, many Nigerians have fled their homes and fled to neighboring countries in search of safer places to escape the fighting. But the situation in Nigeria has remained tense as the army continues to struggle to contain the extremists, who have seized large swaths of territory and are still holding large numbers of troops. Many of them are fleeing to neighbouring countries such as Cameroon or Chad to seek refuge in safer areas. However, there is still a long way to go in order to reach the end of this conflict, said a lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. His client said he would not be able to travel to Cameroon for medical treatment if he did not receive a medical check-up on his condition. If he does not make it, his lawyer said, it would be difficult for him to make a decision. 'We are not going to give up on this fight,' he added. For now, however, Nigeria is facing an uphill battle to stop the jihadists from gaining control of its territory, and it is not clear how long it will take to achieve that goal. There is also the threat of renewed attacks from Islamist groups in neighboring Cameroon that have claimed the lives of several Nigerian soldiers. This is the first time the government has faced such a challenge in its efforts to stem the flow of militants into Nigeria and to prevent them from returning to their strongholds. Although the insurgency has gained strength in some areas, security officials have warned that they will continue to face difficulties in reaching their goal of securing the borders of their respective countries.

The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa) "

The German bank's chief executive officer is to take over the helm of the struggling German lender. "We are in a very difficult time right now," he said at a news conference in Berlin on Tuesday. Martin has been in the job since 1983, when he took over from his predecessor, the German-born CEO, who was fired by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in 1983. Since then, he has led the bank to a total of 18 billion euros ($25 billion) in assets under management. In his first year in office, Blessing said he would continue to lead the lender until the end of 2009. He added that he hoped to continue the company's strong performance in Europe, where the economy is still recovering from the Great Recession and the euro zone debt crisis. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters) - type-of-footer: "I am very happy with the progress we have made so far, and I am looking forward to the next phase of our journey," Blessing told reporters in an interview. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us' He said that "we are going to be able to deliver on the promises we made to our customers and our shareholders." He also promised to cut costs by "a third" in 2009, which would reduce the total cost of capital by $1.1 billion, to $2.5 billion from $3.6 billion. But he did not say how much he planned to reduce costs, saying he was "very optimistic" about the prospects for the business going forward. It is unclear whether Blessing will stay on as CEO for another five years, or if he will be replaced by a new CEO who will take the reins at the start of next year's financial year, in which he is expected to stay in charge until at least mid-2009, according to Reuters calculations based on current market conditions and estimates from a German financial industry expert.

A statement by Blessing also noted that the country's unemployment rate had fallen to 6.7 percent in 2013, down from 7.8 percent the previous year. s/jw, AFP, dpa (Reuters) – "It was a tough time for our economy to recover," the statement said, adding that unemployment rates had risen to 8.4 percent and wages were up to 9.2 percent, up from 5.3 percent a year earlier. However, unemployment has remained at 4.9 percent this year and unemployment is forecast to remain at 6 percent for a third consecutive year - the lowest level since the beginning of this financial crisis in 2003, although the figures do not appear to indicate a significant drop in unemployment among the unemployed since that time frame, it added to concerns about a possible rise in wage inflation and wage stagnation in recent years. On the other hand, there is no sign of a slowdown in wages, employment or wage growth that is likely to increase as a result of higher taxes and higher minimum wage increases, said the spokesman, referring to unemployment benefits for unemployed people and other measures taken by the government to tackle the problem of high unemployment and low wage earners. This is not a surprise to anyone who has worked in finance for more than 25 years and who knows how long it will remain in that job for many years to come - but it is certainly not something that we expect to see in future, given the current economic conditions. What is important to note is that this is the first time that a company has experienced a downturn in its history and that it has not yet experienced the kind of economic recovery that has helped it recover from its worst recession in decades.

The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters) "

The Health Commissioner, Androulla Vassiliou, told the European Commission on Monday that there was a "significant increase" in cases in 2007 compared to the same period in 2001. "This is the first time that we have seen a significant increase," he said in a statement, adding that it was "very concerning" for the EU to see such an increase. He added that "it would be very worrying" if the figures were to be extrapolated to other EU member states. France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the Baltic states are among the countries with the highest rates of infections. In addition, the Commission said, there had been an "increase in infection rates" between 2007 and 2007, compared with 2001, when there were a total of 1.5 cases per 100,000 people. However, it did not say how many cases were linked to a single virus, or whether the outbreak was caused by a virus that was transmitted to people through contact with infected bodily fluids or by contact between infected people and infected animals. There were no new cases reported last year, but it is unclear whether there have been any new infections since then. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold The Commission also said it would continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine, where there is a high level of infection. It said that in some cases, people have died due to exposure to viruses such as the H5N1, H6N2 and H7N8, which can be transmitted via contaminated water or through contaminated soil. But it also warned against underestimating the risks posed by such viruses, saying that they could cause "serious health problems" and "severely affect the lives of millions of people." The commission also called on the government of Ukraine to step up its anti-virus campaign, warning that if it failed to do so it could result in more infections and deaths among people living with HIV-infected people, including those living in Europe's poorest countries, who could be at risk of dying from the disease. Dfm and AFP Managing Director, Dr. Peter Dutton, said he was concerned about the impact of such a campaign on public health, particularly among children and young people who are at high risk for developing HIV and who may be in need of immunization. 'We have to act now,' he added, referring to efforts to prevent the spread of this virus in schools, hospitals, schools and other places where children are immunized against it, as well as in countries where it has been found to have spread to their homes and schools. And he called for an end to this campaign in order to protect children from being exposed to it and prevent it from spreading to others who might not be able to live with it if they are infected. At the end of last week, France and Italy agreed to cooperate on a vaccine against the infection, while Spain and Portugal signed a deal to allow the vaccine to go into use in their own countries. Italy and Spain have also signed an agreement to work together to reduce the amount of vaccine available to them, although the two countries have yet to agree on how to use it. Meanwhile, Germany and France have said they will cooperate to ensure that vaccines are not used against people suffering from HIV, a disease that is highly resistant to vaccination and which they have not yet tested positive for. They also want to make sure that all vaccine applications are approved for use by EU health authorities, and that vaccine testing is carried out in accordance with EU guidelines. All EU countries are expected to take part in this process, with France leading the way in introducing a new vaccine for HIV in its first year of operation in late 2007. That will be followed by the introduction of new vaccines in early 2008 and in later years by countries that have already approved the use of these vaccines for their children. Other countries will also be invited to join the campaign as part of an EU-wide initiative to combat the epidemic. "

In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must "take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing." A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold "

UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said on Monday that UN investigators were looking into allegations that the government of Nepal had engaged in human-rights abuses. The UN said the allegations were made against Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai, the country's most powerful leader since 1996. "The UN is calling for an independent investigation into the matter," Ban said in a statement, adding that he was "deeply concerned" by the accusations. Nepal's government has denied any wrongdoing and said it would cooperate fully with the investigation. However, UN officials said they were not ruling out the possibility of a UN inquiry, which could lead to the arrest of the prime minister and the resignation of his deputy. A UN report released on Sunday, however, said there was no evidence that any such investigation had been carried out in the past two years, and that it was not possible to determine whether or not the charges against the leader were politically motivated. Ban's visit to Nepal follows a series of UN-mandated meetings between the two countries, in which he met with leaders of various political parties. In the first meeting since the election, Ban had called on the leaders to cooperate in resolving the issue. He said he would meet with them "in due course" and would make a decision "as soon as possible." Nepal has been under UN sanctions since 2006, when it annexed the disputed Himalayan state of Kathmandu from the United States. It has also been accused of supporting the Maoists in their insurgency. rc/msh (AFP, AP) - type-of-footer The United Nations has said that Nepal is committed to ending the use of force against its own people, but it has yet to make any concrete progress on that front. At the same time, it is not clear whether Nepal will continue to use force in its fight against terrorism, or whether it will simply continue using force as a means of stopping the spread of terrorism and other forms of violence in an attempt to undermine the rule of law and protect the interests of its citizens and their rights to live and work in peace and security in accordance with international humanitarian law, as well as the right to self-determination and freedom of expression in all its forms, according to UN guidelines on how to deal with armed conflict in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Iran and Yemen. There is also a question of whether there is sufficient political will to stop the killing of unarmed civilians by armed groups, including the armed forces, if there are sufficient numbers of people willing to take part in such an operation, a spokesman for Ban told AFP news agency, referring to a draft UN resolution that was drafted by UN special rapporteur on armed conflicts in 2006 and 2007, saying that there were "a number of factors" that could influence the decision-making process in this regard. RC/MSh/AP (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa, hwm/hwk, bp, iu/vhk), AFP/Getty Images The draft resolution is expected to be signed by Ban and UN secretary general Ban is due to hold a news conference later Monday in New York, where he will address a meeting with Nepalese President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday to discuss the situation in his country. India is the world's largest democracy, with more than 2.5 million people living in poverty than in any other country, he said. But he added that "it is important for us to have a clear picture of what is going on in our country and how we are going to respond to this situation." India has long been a staunch ally of China's military and political leaders, who have fought alongside the Nepali government for decades. Last year, India signed an agreement with China to allow the military to carry out military operations in Afghanistan. Since then, there have been no formal talks with Nepal, although the army has made several attempts to do so in recent months. "

New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll.

For example, the "ZWIE BELKUChen" is a popular product in the German market. But it's not the only one. There are many others, too, such as the Z-shaped Zwerke, which is sold in a variety of sizes and shapes, as well as in many other countries. These products are designed to be used in all kinds of industries, from pharmaceuticals to food processing to medical devices, and they all come with a price tag of around €1,000 (around $2,500) per kilogram (about $3,600) for a very low-cost product. They also come in several different shapes and sizes, ranging from small and medium-sized, to large and large. The most common of these is the zwielke. It's a small, light-weight product that can be worn on the back of a shirt or a pair of jeans, while the rest of the body is made of steel. In addition to this, it has a wide range of colors and textures, making it easy to see the difference between the two products. This is especially true when you consider the fact that the product is only available in one form or the other. For instance, if you want to buy a larger version, you'll have to purchase a smaller version. And that's just the beginning. You'll also need to make sure that you have the right materials and materials for each product, so that when it comes to the final product you can use it in any way that suits your tastes and tastes. That said, there is no doubt that this product will be a hit with consumers, especially those who don't have access to a high-quality product like the one we have here. We also have a few other product categories that we are working on, including the following: The first one is called "Federweizer," which means "fiberglass," and the second one, "Gingerglass." The latter category is also known as "giftware" and is available for purchase from the manufacturer's online store, where customers can purchase it directly from their local store or online retailer for $1.99 per kg (approximately $4.95 for the full-size version). The third category, however, is more expensive and requires more time and effort to develop. "It's very expensive," says the company's marketing director, who says it will cost around $5,300. However, he adds that it is worth it because "it's the first time we've done something like this in over a year and a half and we're not sure how much longer we'll be able to do it," he says. He also says that he's looking forward to working with other manufacturers to improve the quality of their products, adding that they are more environmentally friendly than the ones that have been used for many years. So far, this has been a success, with the exception of one product category that has only recently been introduced to Germany. I think the best part of this is that people are willing to pay a bit more for it, because it offers a better quality product than what is currently being offered in other markets. With that, we can expect to get a much better product at a lower price than we would have if we had used the same product last year. What's more, though? Well, that doesn't mean that there isn't a great deal of money involved in developing these products at the moment. Especially when compared to other companies that offer them, they can't afford to invest in them because they're less expensive than they would be without the additional costs of developing them. Therefore, I would recommend using them in order to reduce the cost of production and to increase the efficiency of products that do not meet the needs of our customers. Also, these are products which are very popular with German consumers. "
,"Reference text": " A Delicious Accompaniment for Wine A regular companion of the fall season's wines is a treat called Zwiebelkuchen, literally, onion cake. It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine. " 

},{"Generated text": " China's Uighurs are the most persecuted ethnic group in the world, according to a study by the Chinese scholar Dru Gladney. In China, the majority of the population is Hui, a Han Chinese who is considered to be Muslim. DW spoke to Haiyun Ma, who teaches at the University of Xi'an in China's eastern region, about the situation in Xinjiang. He told DW that there are a number of ethnic groups that are persecuted by Chinese authorities, including the Muslim minority. "There is a lot of discrimination against Muslims," he said, adding that many of them have been persecuted because of their religion. But he also said that it is not only the Muslims who have suffered persecution, but also the people who suffer persecution because they are not able to speak the same language as their neighbors. The persecution of Muslims is also a problem for many other minorities, such as the Arab minority in Ningxia and the Mongol minority, as well as other minority groups in other parts of China. These groups are often persecuted for their religious beliefs and practices, which can lead to persecution and even death. It is this persecution that has led to the recent wave of anti-Muslim protests in Beijing and Shanghai. This is the first time in Chinese history that a minority group has been targeted by a single government, even though they have a majority Muslim population. That is, until recently, when a group of Chinese students from Pomona College in California organized a student protest against the government's decision to ban the Haj pilgrimage in Yinchuan, an area near the city of Gangsu. According to Shi'atar scholars, this was the beginning of a long-running conflict between the Han and Muslim communities. During this time, there was a great deal of violence, especially during the Hijab period. There was also an increase in attacks on mosques and other places of worship, and a rise in violence against minorities. At the time of this protest, thousands of people were forced to flee their homes in search of greener pastures. Today, more than 100,000 people have fled the country to escape the violence and persecution. Many of those fleeing the war have returned to their homeland, where they seek refuge in their own homes. They are now living in a modern-day city called "Quinghai," which is located on the outskirts of Shanghai and has a population of about 1.5 million people. Since the end of World Muslim Revolution in 1950, China has seen a surge in Muslim migration, with the influx of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa. More than half a million Muslims have migrated to China in recent years, making it the fastest growing Muslim-majority country in Asia. Most of these migrants have settled in cities in western China and are seeking a better life. However, many are still struggling to find a place to live in Shanghai, Beijing, Shanghai or other major cities. For example, in Guangzhou, people are moving to Shanghai to seek a new life, while others are staying in rural areas in northern China for a longer period of time. Some are even planning to move to Dubai. Others are looking for jobs in Dubai or Dubai, for example. A few years ago, I visited Dubai and learned that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had a similar situation. I was surprised to learn that UAE students were fleeing from their home country and that they were being persecuted. So I decided to visit Dubai in order to see what I could do there. What I found was that I had never heard of such a thing before. And I didn't even know what it was like to go there, so I thought it would be a good idea to try and get a job. Then I went back to my homeland and I learned about it. Now I'm back in my home state of Yunnan and it's a very different story. You can't go anywhere without going to Mecca or Medina. People are very afraid of Mecca and Medina and they're afraid that Mecca will be the place for them to do their Haj. When you go to Medina, you'll find that you're not allowed to enter Mecca, Medina or any other place where you can do Haj, because that's the only way to get Haj in Mecca. "
,"Reference text": " The Hui - China's preferred Muslims? While the Muslim Uighurs are increasingly being persecuted, the largest Chinese-Muslim minority, the Hui, are under less scrutiny and thriving as a religious community. DW examines the reasons behind this phenomenon. Walking through the Muslim quarter of Xi'an is a fascinating venture into a hodge-podge of cultures. The smell of lamb skewers and hot spices wafts through the crowded streets. Chinese-looking women in headscarfs stretch noodles, while an old man with a white prayer hat stands in front of a mosque with a distinctly Chinese arched roof. This is the home of the Xi'an Hui Muslim people, where Islam was introduced to China for the first time in the 7th century. China's Muslim population now numbers 23 million, of which over 10 million are estimated to be Hui, and a little under 10 million Uighur. While their fellow Muslim Uighurs in the Xingjiang Uighur Autonomous Region are experiencing severe restrictions on their religious freedoms, the Hui mostly practice their faith openly, and in certain areas are enjoying a resurgence in their religious participation. The reason for their success has to do with centuries of remarkable assimilation, while also maintaining their identity. A history of assimilation Historically, the Hui people are descendants of Persian, Arab and Mongol merchants on the Silk Road, who came to China over 1,200 years ago. Since then, intermarriages with the Han Chinese have meant that the Hui became ethnically mixed and spread across the country. Over the centuries, the Han and Hui have lived relatively peacefully next to and with each other. The Hui took the path of assimilation, speak Mandarin and adapted their religious traditions to the local customs. One of the most visual examples of this is the great mosque of Xi'an, said to be one of the largest and oldest in China. The place of worship is built up of multiple courtyards and sports arches and tiled roofs that clearly show influences of traditional Chinese architecture. While some Hui now live a life culturally and religiously indistinguishable from Han Chinese in first-tier cities such as Shanghai or Beijing, many cities in China have a significant Hui Muslim minority population with close-knit communities, especially in the northern provinces of Ningxia, Gangsu or Quinghai. Traditionally traders, many Hui people are also economically successful today, and according to estimates, their religious participation is growing. Increasing religiosity Dru Gladney, professor at Pomona College in California and leading scholar on the Hui people, estimates that today there are twice as many mosques in China as there were in 1950, of which a majority were built by Hui Muslims. "The amount of practising Muslims among the Hui is rising," Gladney told DW. "For example, there is a dramatic increase in the number of Hui women wearing the Hijab." Gladley adds that "the numbers of Hui going on the Haj are going up constantly." One of the reasons for this is the increased communication with other Muslim groups and the ensuing influence of outside Islam – either through Hui scholars returning from the Haj or from increased business relationships with the Middle East. Trade between China and the Middle East is growing ever more important for the communist country. As a measure to attract Arab business, Yinchuan, the capital city of Ningxia and one of the Hui hubs, has gotten a makeover. Construction of a new $3.7 billion Islamic theme park called World Muslim City is underway, and Arabic lettering has been added to the city's street signs. Haiyun Ma, a Hui scholar at Frostberg University takes a critical position with regard to the Chinese government's perceived friendliness toward the Hui. She told DW that it is more of a sign of "business interest, not of religious tolerance." On the business side, Hui Muslims do play a role as middlemen in trade between the Middle East and China. Because of their knowledge of Arabic, numerous Hui people are working in Dubai, and for Middle Eastern businesses in China. Keeping out of politics Another reason for the Hui's relative freedom are the characteristics that distinguish them from the Uighurs. The second-largest Muslim minority is ethnically distinct, and does not speak Mandarin as a first language. Most importantly, they have a homeland that they wish to claim. The majority of Uighurs live in the far-western province of Xinjiang. Many of the ethno-religious group seek independence from China, and the Uighurs as such are oppressed for it. During this year's Ramadan, they were forced to break fast and parts of their community were not allowed to attend prayers or travel. Most recently, all citizens of Xinjiang were ordered to hand in their passports. But the Hui, partly also due to their diversity and geographic diaspora, and partly because of their cultural closeness to Han Chinese, have no political aspirations of independence, Gladney said.

},{"Generated text": " Bayern defeat Hannover in Bundesliga final Bayern Munich have lost their last two matches in the Bundesliga. The Bavarians have now lost three in a row in their opening two games of the season. Last Saturday, they lost 3-0 at home to Hannovers. In their first match since the end of September, Bayern had to settle for a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Nuremberg on Saturday afternoon. That was Bayern's first defeat in three games in all competitions this season, and it was a disappointing result for the visitors. They had been on the back foot all season and were unable to find a way past the first half of their second half, which was marred by a late goal by Stefan Aigner. But Bayern were able to get back into the game after the break thanks to a goal from Adelino Vieirinha, who scored the equalizer in his first Bundesliga start since September. "It was an excellent performance," said Bayern coach Klaus Allofs, whose side have won three straight league matches, including the last three. He added to that with a header from Lewis Holtby's cross from the penalty spot. Bayern, meanwhile, have been struggling to cope with the loss of a key player in Javi Martinez, the Dutchman who has been out of action for more than a month with an ankle injury. It was the second time in as many games that Bayern have failed to win a Bundesliga match in two weeks, with just one win in that span. A loss in September has left the club in dire straits, having lost two of its last four matches and drawing one point from a penalty shoot-out in August. This time around, though, it has not been easy for Bayern to come back from behind and win the match, as they were already down to just two points from their previous three matches. And that's not to say that they will not be looking to make a run at their next opponent, but they have to do so in order to avoid a repeat of last season's defeat to Borussia Dortmund. On the other hand, there is no reason to doubt that the German side will be better equipped to deal with this loss than last year, when they beat Mainz 4-2 in Dortmund and won the league by just a single goal. German coach Jürgen Klopp has said that he is "very happy" with his side's performance against the Wolfsburg side, despite the fact that it is still a very young side. However, he has also been impressed by the manner in which his team have responded to the defeat. After all, this is a team that has lost a lot of players in recent years, not just because of injuries but also because they are not fit enough to play in front of full-back, Mario Mandzukic and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. There is also the question of whether the team's new goalkeeper, Lars Unnerstall, is ready to step up his game and take over the reins of responsibility for keeping Bayern from falling down the pecking order. If so, then it's a good sign for all concerned. Dortmund, however, will have a tough task ahead of them if they want to keep up the pressure on Bayern and keep their top-four hopes alive. For the most part, that means they can't afford to give up on their star striker, Toni Kroos, or any other player who they consider to be a threat to their title hopes. So far, so good for them, even if it means conceding a few more goals than they would like to concede. At the same time, Dortmund have made it clear that their squad is not going to allow them to continue playing without the help of an experienced goalkeeper. As a result, their goalkeepers have become more and more defensive than ever before, especially when it comes to free-kicking and goalkeeping. With that in mind, Klopp is hoping that his squad can continue to improve on its recent form, particularly in attack and in defense, where they've struggled to establish themselves as a force in midfield.

Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where Jürgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther Fürth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan Fürstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances. " 

},{"Generated text": " Argentine importers sell Porsche cars to Germany Argentina's Porsche importer said on Wednesday that it had sold its Porsches in Argentina for 384 million euros ($545 million) in 2010. According to a report in the German newspaper Deutsche Welle, the company was selling the cars from Germany to Argentina. "We are very happy with the results," said Porsche's Argentina representative, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. The company said the sales figures were "inadequate" for Argentina, and that the prices were not comparable to those in Germany. Argentina is the world's second-largest market for Porsche vehicles, behind Germany's Daimler and BMW's BMW. In March 2010, Porsche announced that Argentina would be the first country to sell its cars abroad. However, it did not say how much the sale would cost, or whether it would affect the competitiveness of its domestic market. Porsche said it was not aware of any price differences between Argentina and Germany at the time, but that there was a "significant gap" between the two countries. It also said that in order to compete for market share, Argentina will need to increase its production capacity by at least 10,000 vehicles a year. Meanwhile, German carmaker Volkswagen has announced plans to buy its stake in Amarok, a joint venture between Volkswagen and Porsche, in a move aimed at boosting sales in Latin America's largest economy. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau The move comes after a series of scandals over the past few years. Among them was the scandal involving the purchase of a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter by a German company, BMW, which was later sold to Volkswagen. That scandal led to accusations that Porsche had paid bribes in exchange for the deal. Volkswagen, however, has denied the allegations, saying it has not done anything wrong. BMW has also been accused of paying bribes to its suppliers, accusing them of lying about the price of their products and of failing to disclose the exact amount of money they paid to suppliers. Germany and the United States have also accused Argentina of violating its anti-trust laws by selling its vehicles to foreign companies, including the state-owned state of Buenos Aires, as well as the country's oil and gas industry. But the Argentine government has rejected the accusations, arguing that they are politically motivated and should not be allowed to take part in any legal action against the car manufacturer. 'Porsche is not responsible for this,' the government said in an official statement, adding that "porsche does not have the legal authority to do so." The government is also investigating allegations of corruption and misuse of government funds, according to German media reports. Car dealers have said they have not seen any evidence of wrongdoing by Porsche in recent years, although the automaker has said there is "no evidence" that any wrongdoing has been committed in connection with its involvement in this case. Experts say the case against Porsche is complicated by the fact that Argentine authorities have yet to decide on whether or not Porsche will be able to purchase the vehicles from German companies. They also say Porsche has a long history of cooperating with Argentina in its efforts to develop its own products, such as its new "Amarok" model. This is one of several Porsche models that have been sold by Argentina to other European carmakers. Another Porsche model is called the "Sprinter," which is based on the same platform as a BMW and is available in several other countries, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and South Korea. Although it is still in development, there are currently no plans for a Porsche-branded version to enter the market, experts say. A Porsche spokesman told the newspaper that he could not comment on pending litigation. He added that a decision was still being made regarding the matter at a later date. “We do not know what the outcome of this litigation is,” he said, referring to an ongoing legal dispute between Porsche and Argentina’s government over ownership of an Argentine-made Porsche brand and a contract with Germany-based car maker, Amadler, for example.

Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. "Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports," she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. "Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector." Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. "For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market," the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. "Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government." Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new "Amarok" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its "Sprinter" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau "

The move comes after the EU's top diplomat, Frans Timmermans, accused the Polish government of violating the Rule of Law Framework (RULEF) in a letter sent to the bloc's vice-presidents on Wednesday. Poland has denied the allegations, saying it had no legal basis to do so. However, the Commission said it was "deeply concerned" by the move, adding that it did not see any reason to expel the deputy minister. "We are deeply concerned about the situation in Poland," the Vice-President said on Facebook, referring to a draft document drafted by Polish Prime Minister Viktor Orban in the wake of a row over the handling of the disputed referendum. In a statement, Poland said the decision was made "in accordance with the rules and regulations of our European Parliament." The European Commission, which is responsible for EU affairs, said that the expulsion was a "serious and serious violation of international law." It also said Poland had failed to comply with its obligations under EU law, including the right to self-determination, and that Poland should not be allowed to impose its own laws on its citizens. On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Dutch Foreign Ministry told reporters that a decision had been taken on the matter, but that there was still "no clear conclusion" as to whether Poland would be able to implement the new rules. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa) - type of footer The Dutch government has accused Poland of trying to interfere in its domestic affairs by using "illegal means" such as the use of force against citizens of other countries. It is also accused of failing to protect the rights of Polish citizens, who have been living in exile for more than a decade in Hungary and the Netherlands, where they were among the first to flee the country after a failed attempt at independence from Hungary in 2007. But the government denies the accusations, arguing that its actions were politically motivated and not in line with EU rules, as it has repeatedly denied accusations of abuse of power by former prime minister and member of parliament (PiS). The Netherlands has also called on Poland to step down from its post-war government, accusing it of using excessive force in order to maintain its image as a liberal democracy and a free and democratic state. Read more: Polish PM resigns from cabinet amid row Over disputed vote The EU has called for a referendum on whether to allow the controversial referendum to take place before the end of this year, in which Poland is expected to vote in favor of an outright rejection of EU-wide rules on how to deal with disputed referendums and other contentious issues. At the same time, it is not clear whether the referendum will be carried out in any way that will affect Poland, or whether it will simply be a symbolic vote on an issue that has already been voted down by other EU member states and which are currently in dispute with Poland and its government over its decision to withdraw its candidacy for re-election in early 2018. There are also concerns that Polish President Law and Justice (PvdA) could be removed from office if the vote fails to go ahead as planned, according to Polish media reports, citing unnamed unnamed sources close to Poland who are not authorized to speak publicly about their views. Is it possible to remove Polish officials from their posts without the approval of European parliament? The Commission has not yet decided whether or not Poland will accept the results of Wednesday's vote, although the commission has indicated it would consider the possibility of doing so, if it does not accept a vote of no confidence from Polish parliamentarians and MEPs, at the next meeting in Brussels in mid-July. What is the most important thing about this vote? Is there a clear message from Poland that this is an important step forward for Poland in terms of its political position in Europe? Does Poland want to be left out of Europe's political process? In the short term, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen next. Many observers believe that, given the current political situation, Polish politicians are more likely to stick to their positions than they are to accept an outcome that could lead to further political instability.

The move has been questioned by officials, with some saying it places the EU at-risk of taking sides in an internal dispute. The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. "I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland," Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering "into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary." He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. "We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about," Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. "The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities," Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page. The Rule of Law Framework was created two years ago as a response to criticism that the 28-nation bloc had not adequately responded to possibly-authoritarian moves taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his tenure. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa) "

However, he added, "I will not be resigning from my post until we are in a position where we can work together as a responsible government." The Polish People's party (CPP), which has been in power since the fall of communism in Poland, was also accused of attempting to influence the outcome of a parliamentary election in which it lost its majority in parliament.

Both the Central Bank chief and Finance Minister have denied any wrongdoing, while the Labour Party has said there was no reason to believe that the bank should be allowed to borrow money from poor families or poor people who are unable to afford to pay their rent or to have their children enrolled in private schools or work in jobs that are less than a year away from full-time employment.Slk andrc said in an interview with Polish daily Wprost that "it is very difficult to convince people that this is the right way to go about life in this country," adding: "There is a lot of pressure on us to make sure we do what we want and we don't do it because it is our duty to help the poor."

},{"Generated text": " Virroa mite kills honey bees in Bonn, Germany Bees are being attacked by varroas mites, which can cause serious damage to the honey bee. According to a study published in the journal "Bee Research Institute" (BRI), bees are suffering from a number of diseases. One of the most serious of these is a severe case of insecticide poisoning. In the summer of July, bees can be attacked with a variety of deadly insecticides. This is the second time in as many years that bees have been hit by a pest. The first time was in 2010, when bees were attacked in July. Since then, they have suffered a series of severe infections, including one that killed more than 100 bees. But this time around, the damage has been much less severe. "We have seen a lot of damage," said Dete Papendieck, a bee researcher at the University ofBonn in Germany. It's not just bees who are affected by the pest, but also the bees themselves, who suffer from the disease. There have also been cases of bee-borne diseases, such as the varroda moth, that have killed thousands of honeybees in recent years. These diseases have caused the bee population to shrink by about 1.5 percent, according to studies conducted by BRI. However, this has not been the case in Europe, where bee populations have fallen by around 10 percent since the beginning of 2010. A recent study by researchers from Germany's Bee Research institute found that the virus was responsible for the deaths of over 1,000 honeybee species. That is, until recently, only a handful of bees had been infected with this virus. Now, it appears that it has spread to Europe and Asia, with the exception of a few European bee species that were infected in India and China, and which have not yet been completely eradicated. So far, however, there are no signs of an outbreak of this type of disease, although it is suspected that there may still be outbreaks of it in other parts of Europe. What's more, these diseases are spreading in Asia and Europe as well as in Africa and the Middle East. As a result, many European honeybears have become infected by this disease and have had to be euthanized in order to prevent it from spreading to other areas. For example, in China and India, for instance, some honey-bee colonies have died out, leaving only one species of moth left to survive: Apis mellifera. Author: Gönna Ketels Editor: Nathan Witkop (Deutsche Welle) The problem is that this is not the first case where a single insect has killed off a large population of pollinators. Instead of killing off the entire pollinator population, researchers are trying to find a way to kill it off by breeding it back into the wild. They are also looking for new species to replace the old ones. And they are looking at several new types of insects that are already on the market. Some of them have already been introduced to Asia as part of their diet, while others are just beginning to develop their own food webs. At the same time, studies have shown that these insects are becoming more and more common in Asian and European bees, as they migrate from Asia to Africa. With this in mind, scientists are hoping that they will be able to fight off this new threat. 'Varsal' Mites are a common pest in many Asian countries, especially in developing countries like India. If they can't be killed by humans, then they must be wiped out by other insects, or they could be eaten by bees and other animals. Experts say this could lead to an even bigger problem: the spread of such a disease that can kill off large numbers of species within a short period of time. Therefore, experts are calling for an end to this epidemic of pest infestations and a new approach to protecting bees from diseases that could harm the health of other species, particularly bees or other honeybeets. More research is needed in this area, says Klaus Maresch, professor of entomology and biophysics at UB. He says it's important to understand the impact of pesticides on bees' health, because it can have a negative impact on their health. "
,"Reference text": " Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees – the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents – formic acid – and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. "It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph," Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite – one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. "It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany," Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. "It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. "They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world," he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool – a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. "Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa," Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. "That's nature," he says, "I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem." The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. "There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers," he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to " 

},{"Generated text": " EU Health Commissioner warns of 'dangerous' alcohol trade The European Union's health commissioner has warned against "dangerously dangerous" beer trade. Markos Kyprianou, a member of the European Parliament, said he was "very concerned" about the growing number of cases of alcohol-related health problems in the EU. "I am very concerned," he said in an interview with the London Institute for Alcohol Studies (LIA). "It is very concerning to me that there are so many people who are not aware of how dangerous it is to drink alcohol and to be in a situation like this." "We have a very serious problem, and we are going to have to deal with it very quickly," said Peter Liese, the head of Germany's Brewers of Europe (BOOE), a trade group that represents the German Brewers Association and the Green party of parliamentarians. The EU has already taken steps to address the issue. In a statement released on Wednesday, German Health Minister Peter Hahn said that "we are concerned that this is a dangerous and dangerous trade and that it will lead to the loss of jobs and economic growth in Europe." But he also warned that the situation in Germany was not good enough to prevent the spread of harmful alcohol into other European countries, such as the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, among others, as well as other EU member states, including the UK and Germany. He also called on the government to take action to protect the interests of European consumers, particularly those who rely on alcohol as a source of income for their livelihoods. German parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer, who chairs the parliamentary committee on consumer affairs, told the Der Tagesspiegel newspaper that he and his colleagues were "extremely concerned about this situation," adding that they had "no idea what the consequences would be" of such a move. However, he went on to say, "The European Commission has a responsibility to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that our consumers are protected from the dangers of drinking alcohol." The German government has also taken a hard line in its stance against the sale of alcoholic beverages, saying that such sales should not be allowed to exceed 125 billion euros ($161 billion) a year. According to Karl-Heinz Florenz, representative for the Brewers' Association, which represents more than 40,000 members, this would amount to "a lot of damage to our economy." In addition, it would mean that German consumers would lose out on a significant amount of their income from alcohol sales, according to Deutsche Welle, an industry publication. It would also be a "huge blow" to German consumer protection if the sales of beer were to go up by 25 percent or more in 2003. But it's not just the beer industry that is at risk of losing out. There are also concerns over the impact of a rise in alcohol prices on consumers. For example, there has been an increase in beer prices in recent years due to a drop in domestic consumption. A recent study by the LIA found that beer sales have risen by 40 percent since the beginning of 2003, compared with a similar period a decade ago. This has led to concern among consumer groups that these prices could rise by up to 50 percent in some countries. And it has caused concern in other countries where alcohol consumption has fallen by as much as 80 percent. As a result of this, many consumers have been forced to cut back on their purchases, with many of them opting out of buying alcohol in order to save money. That is not a good sign for consumers and it could be detrimental to their health, says Dietrich Böhne, chairman of German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DBK), who heads the country's Consumer Affairs and Trade Association (DVT), which is responsible for regulating beer and wine sales. So far, so good, that's been the case, but the problem is that Germany has not been able to find a buyer for its beer. What is the solution? "There is no clear solution to this problem," Höhn said, referring to an EU-wide plan to reduce the tax burden on German beer companies by 20 percent from current levels. "
,"Reference text": " EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced "sometime in the autumn," according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. "Drinking harms your unborn baby" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing "Drinking Kills" or other labels on bottles of beer. "Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go," Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. "The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work." Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. "Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections," said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop "saber rattling" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. "People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine," German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of "passive drinking" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from "passive drinking," Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.

"We are going to have a very good dialogue," Modi said at the end of his two-day visit, according to the Indian news agency PTI, adding that the two leaders would also meet to discuss issues of mutual interest. In the past, India has been at odds with Washington on issues ranging from climate change to energy security. But Modi's visit comes just a few weeks before the world's largest democracy, the United States, is due to convene in Davos, Switzerland, later this month for a round of bilateral talks with China and Russia. US officials have said that they will hold discussions with India on a range of issues, including trade, security and economic issues. However, they have not yet decided whether to go ahead with the talks, which have been delayed by the ongoing US-China trade war, and whether India will continue to pursue its nuclear weapons program in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Middle East. Both countries have expressed concern about China's growing military presence in their respective regions. China has said it will not allow Indian troops to enter its territorial waters, but that it is prepared to take part in any military exercises in its own country. New Delhi's foreign ministry said in a statement that India was ready to participate in talks. It also said India would be willing to cooperate with other countries in resolving the dispute. Indian media reported that China had asked for $120 billion ( $500 billion) to be spent on nuclear power plants in India, a move that was opposed by US lawmakers in Congress. A US official said the move was "inappropriate" and "unprecedented." The US State Department said on Tuesday that Washington would not be able to provide any financial assistance to India if it wanted to do so. According to a US state department statement, it would only provide $14 billion in funding for the project.

Since then, however, Indian companies have refused to sell any of these reactors, leaving the country with only about $2.5 billion to pay for them. At the same time, China is seeking to increase its military budget by $100 billion over the next two years. This has led to an increase in tensions between India and China in recent years, with Beijing threatening to cut off trade with both countries if India doesn't do its part. So far, there are no signs of a breakthrough in terms of reducing tensions. There is no sign of any major breakthroughs in this area, although the Chinese government has indicated it wants to make it a priority to reduce tensions and increase economic activity in Asia. That could lead to increased trade and investment between the countries, especially as China seeks to expand its oil and gas reserves. How will India respond to these developments?

If struck, it would mark the first contract reached under the 2008 US-India civil nuclear accord and pave the way for closer cooperation between the two sides in this arena. PM Modi also wants to use the trip to push for increased trade between India and the US, targeting an almost five-fold rise in bilateral commerce from the currently estimated $120 billion to some $500 billion. Furthermore, both sides have expanded military-to-military exchanges, and the US has emerged as a major arms supplier to India in recent years - selling weapons worth about $14 billion over the past five years.

India, too, has a long-simmering border dispute with China, and both nations fought a brief but bloody war in 1962. "In light of China's growing assertive behavior, the Modi government has not been reluctant to highlight its convergence with Washington on regional issues," Vindu Mai Chotani, a researcher at the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation, told DW. Indeed, in their recent high-level joint statements, both India and the US repeatedly declared their support for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Both nations also highlight their convergence based on democratic values, and respect for rule of law, Vindu Mai noted. In addition, India's engagements with US allies in the region like Japan, Australia and the Philippines have strengthened. At the same time, India and Vietnam have been cooperating on joint oil exploration as well as in the area of maritime security. China has expressed its concern over these developments as well as deepening Indo-US ties, especially on issues such as the inclusion of Japan as a regular member of the Malabar Exercise, a naval drill held annually by the US and India. "The most important takeaway here is that Beijing views Washington's actions, especially in the Asia-Pacific, as the US containment of China," underlined Vindu Mai, stressing that it's therefore difficult for China to see the US engagement with India in a different light. An array of challenges But observers say there are limitations to how far both India and the US are willing to go to forge closer defense ties, despite their mutual interest in ensuring China's peaceful rise. While the US has been pushing for pacts such as a military logistics sharing agreement - which will allow the two militaries to use each other's bases - India has expressed a raft of concerns over these deals, experts point out. "One issue being expressed by Indian policy makers is that the signing of these agreements would lock the country in an irreversible strategic partnership with the US," says Vindu Mai, adding that, "India does not wish to be seen as a strategic ally of the US against China." Furthermore, the US relationship with Pakistan continues to loom large over India-US ties, with New Delhi looking warily at Washington's supplies of aid and armaments - such as F-16 fighter jets - to Islamabad. In the US, meanwhile, there is growing criticism over rising religious intolerance in the South Asian nation and increased restrictions on civil society organizations such as the environmental NGO Greenpeace and the US-based Ford Foundation. Discord over human rights "In the case of US-India relations, the hopeful rhetoric has far exceeded actual, tangible achievements," Bob Corker, Republican Senator and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told a hearing last month. And during a recent speech in New Delhi, Senator Benjamin L. Cardin " 

},{"Generated text": " Berlin: How to cope with the influx of Syrian refugees Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (FOMR) has launched a new campaign to help Syrians fleeing war-ravaged Syria. The campaign aims to make it easier for refugees to reach Germany. In a video posted on YouTube, a Syrian refugee named Jaafar Abdul Karim says he has been living in Berlin for a year and a half now. "I've been in Germany for two years and I've never seen anything like it," he says, adding that he had never heard of the campaign before. According to DW, the goal is to get more Syrians to come to Germany, which has a population of around 1.5 million. However, it's not clear how many Syrians are actually coming to the German capital. DW spoke to a number of Syrians who have arrived in the city in recent months, and they said that they have not been able to find a place to stay for many years. They said they had no idea how long they would have to wait, but that it was a long time before they could get a chance to try it out in their own country. So far, so good, they say. But they're not sure if it will be enough to convince them to go to Syria, or if they'll just stay here and wait for the right time to apply for asylum. There's also the issue of how to deal with refugees who are fleeing conflict and persecution. For example, in Damascus, there's a refugee organization called Pegida & Co. that is trying to persuade people to leave their homes in order to return to their countries of origin. It's called Pro Asyl, because it can be used as an anti-trafficking drug. If you can't find it in your own home, you have no way of knowing what to do with it. You don't even know what you're doing. What do you think about it? Do you really want to live in a country where there are so many people suffering from the same kind of problems? I think it would be a good idea if we could just get rid of some of these problems and get them out of our homes. I don’t think we can do that. We have a lot of people in our country that are struggling with these issues. And we have people who can help us out. That's why we need to work with them." DW also spoke with a German refugee, Raafat Hajir, who is from Damascus. He said he was surprised by the amount of help he received from German authorities in his time in Syria and how easy it is for people like him to travel to Berlin and Berlin to meet with people from all over the world. After all, he said, "Germany is the only country in Europe that does not accept refugees from Syria." He added, however, that there is a need for Germany to be more open and transparent about how it deals with its refugee problem. As a result, people are more willing to give up their Syrian citizenship and become refugees. This is especially true when it comes to refugees, as well as those from other countries, such as Lebanon, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. These are the countries where refugees are most likely to arrive, according to Hafar's research. From his perspective, this is an extremely difficult situation to solve, especially when the situation is so dire. Even if you are a member of a small group of Germans, your chances of finding a solution are very low. How can you help someone who doesn't have the means to move to another country? "It's very difficult to say," said Hafrar. 'I'm not even sure what the solution is,' he added. His father was born in Aleppo and his mother was also born there. Now, his father has returned to Damascus and he's living there with his wife and their two children. All three of his children are Syrian citizens. Their parents are also Syrian nationals. Since the war, many of them have fled their country and are seeking refuge in other parts of Europe, including the United States and Israel. "
,"Reference text": " Refugees in Germany: 'I want to integrate, but how?' Refugees are constantly told that they need to integrate. How are they dealing with that task? Impressions from a Berlin refugee home gathered by DW's Jaafar Abdul Karim. "Do you know the word 'integration'?" I ask a young man that I meet in a Berlin refugee home. "No," he says. Then I use the Arabic word "indimaj." He immediately answers: "I want to integrate, to learn the language and become part of society." He continues that, unfortunately, he has no idea how he is supposed to go about doing so. Adham Ali is 21 and comes from Syria. He has been living in Germany for six months. Until a week ago he was living in a gymnasium in the Spandau district of Berlin with 700 other young men. "Now I am in the refugee home all day. I am trying to learn German via YouTube because I cannot find a spot in a language course." I ask if he has any German friends. He replies: "Where and how should I meet Germans?" More than a million refugees came to Germany last year. People like Adham. Many live in a bubble, in refugee housing, cut off from the outside world. They are, however, aware of the fact that Germany is talking about them and their integration. And many realize that it won't be easy. He knows the issue regarding German values, says Adham - about equal rights for men and women, respecting the constitution, accepting homosexuality. He comes from a small village outside Damascus. "The women there all wear niqab," he says, refering to the head-covering veil that only leaves the eyes visible. Apparently there is no one to help people like Adham Ali find a way to reconcile their old lives with their new ones. I had that impression often during my visit to the refugee home. Some, like Adham, are full of hope nevertheless. He says he wants to continue the law studies that he began in Syria. 'I feel lost' Others are frustrated. Like Raafat Hajir, a 24-year-old Palestinian from Syria. "What do you do all day?" I ask him in Arabic. "I get up, have breakfast, hang around, go to the gym," he says. "Can you speak German?" I ask him in German. "Yes," he says, and tells me that when he arrived he took a German class that he paid for himself, but now he doesn't have any more money. He tells me that as a stateless person he has no right to state-sponsored German courses. Obviously no one has informed him that the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has just changed that rule. He says, "I am a dentist and could work, but what am I supposed to do? I am not allowed to work here!" He even thought about working illegally, but decided against it. He is stuck in limbo. "What is the plan? What can I do to integrate myself into society?" he asks me. He doesn't have any German friends to help him get a start. "How should I meet Germans? Just approach them on the street?" He says he knows a lot of young men that are in the same situation. A few months ago I wrote about integration in my column, about how unproductive it is that many refugees are not allowed to work for months at a time. Back then I proposed a step-by-step plan for integration. Now, a half year later, I am plagued by the feeling that we are still loitering at the bottom of my proposed "integration pyramid." The refugees are here, but we are leaving them to deal with their future on their own. They are sitting around in refugee homes with nothing to do. We are producing frustration in exponential doses. I ask myself: Are those young men, who have no everyday perspective, not the perfect victims for radicals who promise to help them find a purpose in life? Many refugees in Germany have no idea what their rights and responsibilities are. No plan, no idea. Where are the authorities? Why are these young men being abandoned? Do we not want to integrate them, or are we unable to? Why are we constantly talking about them as people that do not want to integrate? If we do not want to make them part of society, then they will not want to make Germany part of their lives either. Demand rather than encourage Many politicians tell refugees: Integrate yourselves, accept our values! Some even threaten: Those who refuse to participate in integration courses should be punished and not be allowed to remain in Germany. The new integration law that the coalition has just passed is also supposed to contain that threat as well. That is why the refugee organization Pro Asyl has dubbed it the "disintegration law": There is no lack of will on the part of refugees, but rather of offers from the federal government. The " 

},{"Generated text": " Steinmeier meets with Georgian Foreign Minister Eka Tkeshelashvili in Tbilisi The German foreign minister has met with Georgia's new president and the head of the Abkhazia-South Ossetia region, Sergei Bagapsh, to discuss the country's future. The two men met on Thursday at the G-20 summit in the Georgian capital. "We have a lot in common," said Steinmeier, adding that the two had a "very good working relationship." The meeting was the first between the heads of state of Georgia and Russia since the Russian-Georgian conflict broke out in 1990. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Georgian President Ilham Aliyev have been at loggerheads over the issue of territorial integrity, which has been the subject of intense international criticism since Russia annexed the region in 1994. Russia has accused Georgia of violating international law by annexing parts of its territory, including the Black Sea, and has threatened to use the territory as a transit point for its own purposes. In response, Georgia has said it will not allow the annexation of territory it considers to be part of Russia's "regime of aggression." "Georgians are not going to allow Russia to annex their territory," the foreign ministry said in a statement, referring to the situation in Georgia. It added that Russia would not recognize Georgia as an independent state and that it would have to take steps to ensure that Georgia does not become a member of a NATO-member state. On Thursday, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution calling for Georgia to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The resolution also called for the return of Russian troops to Georgia, as well as the lifting of sanctions against Russia over its support of separatists in South Ossettia. Tensions between Russia and Georgia have also been on the rise in recent months, with Russia threatening to withdraw its troops from the disputed region if Georgia did not comply with the new UN-brokered peace deal. Moscow has also expressed concern about the possibility of an arms embargo on Georgia that could lead to a conflict with Moscow. A UN report released Thursday said Russia had threatened Georgia with sanctions if it continued to support the separatist government in its fight against Russian aggression. However, Russian officials have said they have no reason to believe that sanctions will be imposed on Russia. Georgia is the only country in Russia that has not signed a UN peace treaty, according to Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti, citing unnamed unnamed sources. But the sanctions have not yet been lifted, although Russia is expected to do so by the end of this month. According to US President Barack Obama, who visited Georgia last week, he will travel to Moscow on Friday to meet with Georgians. He also said that he would visit Georgia on Saturday to see if there were any signs of progress on a peace accord between Moscow and its belligerent neighbors. Steinmein said he had not seen any sign of any breakthrough in talks between Georgia or Russia, but that there was "no sign" that a deal had been reached. Both countries have agreed to resume talks over a possible ceasefire, following a series of failed attempts to reach an agreement last year. US Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier this week that Washington and Moscow had reached a tentative agreement in principle on how to resolve the conflict, though he cautioned that "there is no guarantee that any deal would be reached." In an apparent attempt to avoid a confrontation, US Vice-President Mike Pence said the US would continue to push Georgia toward a ceasefire. “We will continue our efforts,” he told reporters in an interview published Friday in Washington, D.C. Read more: US warns Georgia not to give up on its nuclear weapons program The US has warned Georgia against a nuclear arms race with North Korea, saying it is "not ready" to sign a treaty with either Russia or the United States that would allow it to develop a weapon of mass destruction. NATO has already announced a new round of arms deals with Iran and North Africa in order to prevent such a move from taking place. At the same time, a US delegation is due to visit Moscow next week to attend a meeting of NATO leaders. "
,"Reference text": " German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the "spiral of violence" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. "This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future," he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, "The plan has great potential for success," but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. "Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation," Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. "We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step," he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would "not consider the plan." "We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state," Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: "We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible." From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.

The move comes a day after Britain, the United States, Sri Lanka and the European Union condemned the ouster of his predecessor. On Tuesday, a court in the southern Indian Ocean island of Molloy ruled that the former president, who had been in power since September 2008, was no longer eligible to run for re-election in 2012. In a statement released by the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed said the new president would not be allowed to take office until after the election. "The president is not going to be able to continue as he has been for many years," said Mohamed Anil, spokesman for the MDP, referring to the party's vice presidential candidate, Ahmed Adeeb. Earlier this month, Britain announced that it was suspending its sanctions against the ex-president, accusing him of failing to comply with the terms of an international arbitration agreement reached in 2008. A United Nations investigation has also been launched into the case, which could lead to a new round of sanctions. However, it is unclear whether the sanctions will be lifted at the same time as the elections in March, when the government is expected to hold a referendum on whether or not to allow the president to remain in office. Several other countries have also expressed concern about the situation. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa) - type of footer, size, shape, height, weight, speed and weight The government has said it will continue to investigate allegations of corruption and abuse of power, but it has yet to decide whether to suspend the suspension of its Vice President, Abdulfatah al-Nasheed, pending the outcome of a parliamentary election scheduled for March or whether it would be suspended until the end of 2012, according to an investigation carried out by Britain's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). nm-kmp (AFP, AP, news, twitter)- type-footer. size-of-marshal (mahd/ap, fb, bp, cpa), shape-shifter, power-broker, time-lifter and politician-turned-politician, as well as a number of other senior officials, including the prime minister, and a senior member of parliament (MP), who have been on the run since the beginning of this year's general election campaign, in a bid to shore up support for his party in an election that was widely seen as likely to win the popular vote in favor of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamad's bid for a second term. At the time of announcing the move, Maldive authorities had said they would suspend all presidential and vice-presidency appointments until they could find out how many people were still eligible for election, if any, to fill the vacancy left by President Mohamed Abdulla's departure from office in early 2012 or if they were to return to their former post as vice presidents. It was not immediately clear if the presidential election would take place on Tuesday or Wednesday, although the poll was scheduled to begin on March 1, with a turnout of around 50,000 people expected in line to exceed the official target of 60 percent for that day's vote. Both men were barred from running for president until early next year due to allegations that they had conspired with an opposition candidate to oust the incumbent president in order to prevent him from taking over the reins of government. They have denied the allegations, however, saying they did not have any evidence to back up the accusations against them and that there was "no evidence" of any wrongdoing by either side. Officials have not said whether they will appeal the decision to remove the President from the post of president or to reinstate him as head of state, despite the fact that he is a democratically elected leader and has not yet been given the powers to do so. Most observers believe that a change in leadership could be expected within the next few months, following the announcement of new elections that will see the return of former President Abdulkadir Mansour Hadi's government to power after his term ends in February.

,"Reference text": " Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures "with immediate effect" and that "all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored." President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as "the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy," had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. "It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores," the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa) " 

},{"Generated text": " U.S. condemns Egypt's military intervention in the Middle East The United States has condemned the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, calling it an "unprecedented act of aggression" by the Muslim Brotherhood. The White House has accused the Egyptian military of using excessive force to overthrow the democratically-elected president. In a statement released on February 4, the State Department said it was "deeply concerned" with the military's role in overthrowing Mubarak. "We are deeply concerned," said Tamir Sheafer, an Egypt expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, referring to the Arab world's largest democracy, which was overthrown in a military coup in late 2011. She said the US was also concerned about the security situation in Tunisia, where President Ben Ali had been in power since the fall of the Mubarak regime in 2011, and that the country's security forces were being used as a bargaining chip in an attempt to undermine the regime's rule of law. US President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have also expressed concern over the role of US intelligence agencies in Egyptian security, particularly the CIA and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which are responsible for monitoring the activities of terrorist organizations. Obama has also called on the international community to take a "stronger stance" against the use of military force against civilian targets, as well as against "terrorists" and "terrorist organizations." The US has been accused of supporting the Brotherhood in its attempts to topple the former president, who was elected in November 2011 by a majority of Egyptian voters. However, US officials have denied the accusations, saying they are "baseless and baseless." "The US does not have a position on this issue," Obama told reporters in Washington in August 2010, according to a Washington Post report. He added that "the US is not a party to any kind of regime change." He also pointed out that there was no evidence that any of this was the case in any way, shape, or form of "terrorism." In addition, he said, "There is no reason to believe that this is a terrorist organization." Obama, however, has said that he will continue to work with Congress to find a way to deal with this problem. As the New York Times reported in February, Obama said he would be "very interested" in working with congressional committees to pass the Presidential Study Directive (PSD), a bill that would have allowed the government to carry out military operations against terrorist groups. This bill, known as the "Permanent War on Terror" (PKK), was signed into law by President Obama in June 2010. It was passed by Congress and signed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in May 2010 after a vote of no confidence from the House of Representatives. But the bill was not passed in Congress. Instead, it passed the Senate and is currently awaiting the approval of a presidential study directive (MSP). The Senate has yet to act on its own, but it is expected to do so by early next year. According to The Wall Street Journal, former CIA Director Leon Panetta, a member of Congress who is now a senior adviser to Obama's national security team, told the paper: "I don't think there is any reason why the president should not be able to make decisions on his own. I think it's because he has a lot of power in this country and he doesn't have the power to decide what is best for his country." It is unclear whether Obama will sign the PKK bill or not, given the fact that it would only be passed through Congress if it were to be voted on by his successor, President Mubarak, in order to protect the interests of American citizens. What does this mean for US foreign policy? "It means that we are going to have to look at all the options that are available to us," he told Deutsche Welle, adding that Obama would not sign it if he did not want to sign a law that could be used to combat the threat posed by terrorism and extremism. That is why Obama is pushing for the implementation of an executive order that will allow the state of Israel to use force on terrorism suspects, including those who have been convicted of crimes against humanity.

,"Reference text": " White House ignored multiple warnings about crisis in Egypt There's a general consensus among policymakers and analysts that the uprisings in Egypt and elsewhere were unpredictable. That's untrue. There were plenty of experts who warned concretely about an impending crisis. When hundreds of thousands took to the streets first in Tunis, then in Cairo, Western governments were caught off guard just as much as the dictatorial regimes that were the target of the protests. The US, arguably the country with the strongest interests and the most leverage in the region, was still scrambling to make sense of Tunisian President Ben Ali's swift exit when the next regime, this time in Egypt, crumbled. Without a clear crisis management plan at the ready, the Obama administration's reaction to the events in Cairo waffled between tenuous support for the protestors and continued allegiance with the Mubarak regime, a key US partner in the Middle East. Taken by surprise The remark by Vice President Joe Biden, probably the Obama administration's most experienced foreign policymaker, in the midst of Egypt's uprising that he wouldn't classify Hosni Mubarak as a dictator serves perhaps as the most telling sign that the US government was unprepared for the events that rocked the Middle East. But as it turned out the vast network of US intelligence services was apparently equally flabbergasted by the revolt in Egypt as their political counterparts. While the CIA director's statement before Congress that there was a "strong likelihood" that Hosni Mubarak would step down the same night proved wrong and made the most headlines, the more damaging remark actually came from Leon Panetta's boss. The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, testified before Congress that Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood was "largely secular" and "eschewed violence" only to have his statement later corrected by a spokesman. President Barack Obama, according to a February 4 article in the New York Times, was unhappy with the information and analysis he received on the uprising in the Middle East by his intelligence services. Internal White House study on Egypt However, instead of relying on the CIA and others to prognosticate events in Egypt and elsewhere the president could have simply turned to his own advisors. As reported by the New York Times, Obama himself commissioned a secret review of possible unrest in the Middle East back in August 2010. The so-called Presidential Study Directive concluded that numerous countries in the region were prone to mass unrest without serious political changes, wrote the paper. The 18-page report so far hasn't been officially submitted, but is apparently helping the US deal with the events. Still, the crucial question why the White House didn't act on its in-house information prior to the crisis in the Middle East remains unclear. While the Presidential Study Directive was conducted in secret, the Obama administration also was repeatedly alerted publicly to the dangerous situation in the Middle East, particularly in Egypt. A high-level Working Group on Egypt, consisting of a bipartisan cadre of former government officials, human rights activists and Middle East experts, sent numerous letters to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in spring of last year repeatedly urging the administration to press for serious reforms in Egypt to avert a possible conflict. The heads of the Working Group on Egypt, Michele Dunne and Robert Kagan, then followed up with an op-ed in the Washington Post in June 2010, warning that "the Obama administration, in pursuit of an illusory stability, stands mute and passive as the predictable train wreck draws nearer." And according to the Washington Post, the group also had meetings with senior State Department officials. So why did the administration not heed the advice of the experts? "I think they didn't share the urgency that some of us on the outside felt about this," Michele Dunne, a co-chair of the Working Group on Egypt told Deutsche Welle. "That things in Egypt were deteriorating dangerously, that there could be an explosion at some point if Mubarak didn't undertake some reform measures." Conflicting positions Dunne, who is a Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington and editor of the online journal the Arab Reform Bulletin, thinks the US administration was in two minds about what to do in Egypt. While Washington saw the situation in Egypt deteriorating after the renewal of the state of emergency and the rigged election, it found it difficult to act upon it, adds Dunne. "The United States government has a lot of interests to work with Egypt and I think they weren't really sure how to press strongly for improvements for human rights and democracy while at the same time working with the Egyptian government on diplomacy, security, and counterterrorism." What's more, many experts, not just those inside the Obama administration, simply underestimated the potential for revolt in Egypt. "I think that most analysts didn't take seriously trends and developments that we saw in Egypt over the last few years," argues Dunne. To her the youth bulge in the country coupled with a high level of unemployment and increased political activism over the Internet was an alarm signal. Real revolution But others didn't think so.

Max Meyer, sporting director of the Bundesliga club, is set to take over the role of coach on February 15. According to German news agency dpa, the move is part of an attempt to strengthen the squad's midfield. The move comes after the club announced on January 12 that they had agreed to pay €5.5 million (€6.7 million) to sign the German midfielder. "We are very happy with the result," said sporting Director Domenico Tedesco in a statement released by his office. However, it was not immediately clear whether Meyer would be able to keep the midfielder, who has been linked with a move to Bayern for the past two seasons, at the end of February, or if he would simply be allowed to leave. Meyer has said that he is "very happy" with his new contract, which will see him make his first appearance in the first Bundesliga game since joining Bayern in January. He has also said he will continue to work closely with sporting directors Christian Heidel and Dieter Schleicher, as well as sporting chief Christian Schulz, to ensure that the team's finances are in line with what is expected of them. Schleck has already made a number of changes to his squad in recent weeks, including the addition of midfielder Leongorezki to the starting line-up and the signing of midfield all-rounder Maxim Gorka. Both players are expected to make their first appearances in Germany this season, and will be available for selection at a later date, according to Sport Bild, a German sports magazine. They will also be eligible for a transfer fee of up to a maximum of €6 million ($7.2 million). The club have also announced plans to buy midfielder Artem Dzyuba from Bayern, for whom they have already agreed on a deal worth around a million euros ($8.3 million), according the news outlet. Dzuba, however, has yet to confirm whether the transfer will take place, but it is widely expected that Meyer will make a decision on the matter within the next couple of weeks. It is understood that Dzekuba will stay at Bayern until the summer of 2019, when his contract is due to expire. In the meantime, he has to decide whether or not he wants to continue playing for Bayern. On the other hand, there is the question of whether he can stay on as a coach. If he does decide to do so, then it will have to be decided by how much money he's willing to spend. But it's not just about the money. There is also the issue of how long he'll be in charge of his team. At the moment, Meyer is only in his second Bundesliga season as head coach, having already won two Bundesliga titles with Bayern and Dortmund. His first was in 2012, in which he won the league title and was named as one of Germany's top ten most valuable players. During that time he also managed to win the Champions League, where he was awarded the Golden Boot for his efforts to improve his chances of reaching the top level. That was a major boost for him, especially after he scored the decisive goal against Bayern last week. Now he faces a tough task in front of him. After all, his only chance of making it into the final four is a win over Werder Bremen, whom he beat at home last weekend. As a result of that win, Schölke have been relegated to third-place in their Bundesliga division, with only one point from their last three games. Coach Meyer also faces the prospect of being forced out of a position of leadership. Despite the fact that his side have struggled for some time now, they still have a lot of talent to play for, so it could be difficult to convince him to stick with them, even if it means losing a few key players in order to get the job done. So far, though, that hasn't been the case. For the most part, things are looking up. "

Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. "Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed," Heidel told dpa. "We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either." Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of €5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season.

Schalke offered improved terms in light of this development on the pitch. Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. "At the moment we're still ready to talk," Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. "But we must and we will plan for the new season." In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. "[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case," Heidel said. "He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?' Because one thing's clear: Max wants to play, and he needs to play." Schalke are already preparing for the departure of one of German football's brightest young stars, midfield all-rounder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the season's end.

The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has issued a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) emergency aid package to the islands affected by the Category 4 storm Irma. President Trump on Friday called for the United States to help the affected islands recover from the storm. "We have a lot of work ahead of us," Trump said in a statement issued on his Twitter account. He also called on the international community to "stand up and help us in the face of this storm." The president also said that the US government would continue to work with the government of the Lesser Antilles to prepare for Irma, which is expected to make landfall in Florida later this week. In addition, he said, the federal government will continue its efforts to assist the island's government in its recovery efforts. Trump also expressed his support for President Barack Obama's decision to declare a state of emergency for Puerto Rico and the Bahamas in response to Hurricane Maria. Florida Governor Ricardo Rossello said he was "deeply concerned" about the damage caused by Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as the potential for catastrophic damage from Maria and Hurricane Katia. Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Rick Scott said the state's emergency management system was in "very good shape" and urged the public to remain calm and take shelter in their own homes and businesses. Irma's path is still unclear, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it could take at least a day or two before it reaches the Florida Keys, where it is forecast to reach Category 3 strength. Hurricane Harvey has already caused widespread damage in Texas and Florida, while Maria has caused extensive damage across the Gulf of Mexico and is threatening the Carolinas, Cuba, Mexico, and Hispaniola. Maria is the second major hurricane to hit the U.S. this year, after Harvey hit Texas earlier this month. At the same time, hurricane-force winds have been reported in some parts of Florida. Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said Friday that he expected Irma to weaken to a category 4 or 5 hurricane by Friday evening, with winds of 130 miles per hour (209 kph) and gusts of up to 185 mph (300 kp). The hurricane center said Hurricane Jose, a Category 5 storm, could reach Florida in just a few days. It is not yet clear how much damage the hurricane will cause. Harvey and Irma are the most powerful storms in US history. Both of these storms have caused significant damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure, according to CNN's Brock Long, who spoke at a news conference in Miami, describing the devastation as "unprecedented." "This is an unprecedented storm," he told reporters, adding that "it is unprecedented for a storm to be so strong and so fast. We have never seen anything like this in our entire history," Long said. US President-elect Trump has repeatedly stressed the need for federal assistance for hurricane victims, saying he wants to see a "massive recovery" of victims and their families. On Friday, Trump issued an emergency declaration for all affected areas, calling for an "all-weather emergency" for Florida and other Caribbean states, including the Virgin Islands, to stay in contact with their closest friends and relatives. FEMA also announced that it would provide emergency assistance to those in need of immediate medical care and assistance. As of Friday morning, FEMA was still working to determine the exact extent of damage and how long it will take for Maria to pass through the region. A federal judge in New York ruled that Maria could be a life-threatening threat to Florida's coast. However, federal officials said there was no immediate danger to life or property in any of those islands. Federal officials have said they expect Maria will pass over the central Florida peninsula by Sunday evening. They also expect the remnants of Hurricane Wilma to cross the Atlantic Ocean by Monday night. Weather experts have warned that there is a high chance of Maria crossing into Florida on Sunday night and Monday morning. Forecasters have also warned of heavy rain and high winds. "

The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people – nearly one-third of the population – lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. "It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last," Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. "Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon," Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? "I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I’m sure it’s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe," he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of "absolutely historic destructive potential." Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula.

It will be truly devastating," Long told CNN. "The entire southeastern United States better wake up and pay attention. Death and destruction At least 11 people have been killed and dozens more injured after Irma tore through the French Caribbean, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. "Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical," Duncan told the British Parliament. Thousands displaced Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said nearly every building on Barbuda was damaged when the hurricane's core crossed almost directly over the island early Wednesday and about 60 percent of the island's roughly 1,400 people were homeless.

},{"Generated text": " Merkel calls for a 'new Europe' in 2017 Angela Merkel has called for an end to the EU's "war on terror" and a "new European Europe" in the wake of the Brexit vote. The German chancellor is calling for the end of terror in Europe. "We need a new Europe," Merkel said in an interview with DW in Berlin on Friday. She also called on the European Union to "re-think" its approach to terrorism, which she described as an "unprecedented threat to our security." The chancellor also said that she would not allow Britain or France to take part in "a new European order." "I think we need to rethink the way we think about terrorism," she said, adding that "we don't want to be a part of this new world order, but we have to make sure that we are not a victim of a terrorist attack." But she also stressed the need for Europe to work together in a way that makes sense to her. In the past few months, Germany has been on a collision course with Britain and France over the issue of terrorism. This has led to tensions between the two countries, as well as a growing sense of unease among the German public about the threat posed by the planned EU withdrawal from the Schengen zone. Germany is the only European country that has not been able to agree on how to deal with terrorism in its own way, and that is why it is so important for Germany to stand up for its citizens and to protect its interests. But it's also important to remember that Europe is not just a single country. It's a whole new continent, with different political and economic realities. There are a number of countries in Eastern Europe, including Poland, Poland and the Czech Republic, where the Visegrad Group is based. These countries have a lot in common with the rest of Europe and they all have their own problems. For example, in Hungary, Slovakia and Slovakia, the Balkan countries are the most affected by terrorism and there is a very high level of violence in these countries. That's not to say that there are no terrorist attacks in those countries or that terrorism is something that can't be prevented. However, there have been a few incidents where terrorism has taken place. One of those incidents was in which a suicide bomber was shot and killed by a police officer in Budapest, Hungary. Another was when a bomb went off in Prague, killing two people and injuring dozens of others. DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz reports from London: "It's very difficult to understand what is going on in eastern Europe right now. What is happening is that the situation is very different from what it was before the Maastricht Treaty came into effect." DW: What does this mean for you? What do you mean by "Europe's new terror threat?" What are your thoughts on this? Do you think it will affect your own security? The answer is yes, of course, that it does affect the security of your home country and your family, or the safety of other people's homes and businesses. How does it affect you personally? Does this make you feel better about your country's security situation? Is it something you would like to see happen in other countries? I think the answer to this question is no. I would say no, because it doesn't affect me personally at all. If you look at what we've seen so far, you can see that our country is in very good shape. We're not going to get any more terror attacks from terrorists, we're just getting into a situation where we can do something about it. And that's what's happening in our own country." What's the point of all this, anyway? How do we know what the future holds for us? Well, it depends on what happens next. As far as I can tell, I'm not really sure what will happen next in terms of how Europe will react to a terror attack. Is there any way to prevent this from happening? There's no way of knowing for sure. Does it mean that Britain will be the first country to withdraw from NATO? Why not the US? Because that would be very bad for our national security. Why would it be better if we didn't have this kind of security threat? And what does that mean to us as Europeans? It means that if Britain withdraws its commitment to NATO, then we will have an even worse situation than we had before. So we'll see how that plays out. "
,"Reference text": " Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was "not amused." Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: "Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a "European" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a "political revolution," as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below. " 

},{"Generated text": " German Chancellor Angela Merkel calls for 'European Union' reforms The German Chancellor has called for the European Union (EU) to be reformed in 2017. Merkel is calling for an "EU-wide reform" of the EU. The chancellor has said she wants to see the bloc reformed as soon as possible. German media reported Sunday that Merkel had called on EU leaders to make changes to the way they think about the future of Germany. "The EU is a very important part of our future," Merkel said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, which was published on Sunday. She also said that she would seek a "European union" that would allow Germany to remain in the single market, rather than the customs union. In September, Merkel announced plans to introduce a single currency, the euro, in a bid to "re-establish the common currency of Europe." The move comes as Merkel's conservative Christian Democrat (CDU) party, led by Helmut Kohl, has been criticized by some quarters as a failure to deliver on the promises made by her predecessor, former US President Barack Obama. On Sunday, Germany's largest newspaper, "Die Welt", published an opinion piece in which the CDU leader was quoted as saying: "Merkel has made a lot of mistakes in her first year in office, but she's made up for them." Merkel, who was first elected to parliament in 2005, is expected to win a third term in parliament next year. Her party's platform, dubbed the Alternative for Germany (AfD), will be launched in September. It has already received more than 1.5 million votes in its first round of parliamentary elections, according to a poll published by the magazine "Der Spiegel." It is the first time that the party has won a majority of votes since the fall of Berlin Wall in 1989, when the UK's Labour Party took over the reins of power after Donald Trump's election victory in June. Chancellor Merkel has promised to continue to push for EU reform, even if it means cutting the size and scope of EU membership. However, it is not clear whether she'll be able to do so without the support of her own party or the backing of a US president. Obama has also been critical of Merkel in recent months, saying she should not be allowed to dictate the terms of any EU agreement. But the chancellor's comments come at a time when she is under pressure from the right-wing opposition and the left-leaning ARD party to take a tougher stance on immigration and other issues. Last year, she was criticized for her handling of asylum claims in Germany, a move that was seen as an attempt to stifle free movement of people from across the political spectrum. Since then, however, her government has taken a more measured approach to asylum-seekers and asylum seekers, including those who have fled the country in order to avoid deportation. This has led to an increase in anti-immigrant sentiment and a rise in xenophobic rhetoric in public opinion polls, as well as the rise of far-right parties such as AfD and "Far-Right." In June, German magazine Spiegel published a report calling on Merkel to step down from her post as Chancellor, citing "a lack of political will and an unwillingness to engage in open debate." "We need a strong leader who is willing to stand up and fight for what is right," the paper said, adding that it was time for a new era of "open dialogue" between the two parties. Germany has a long tradition of liberalizing its political system, and it has long been one of its most liberal and democratic institutions, with a number of reforms in place. Many of those reforms have been approved by parliament and are now being implemented by President Obama's administration. Some of these reforms include the creation of an open-door policy for refugees and migrants, while others are being phased out. These reforms are also being pushed through through the Bundestag parliament, where the government will have to decide whether or not to open the doors to refugees from other EU member states. There is also the issue of how to deal with migrants and refugees who are fleeing their home countries. "
,"Reference text": " Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper "Bild am Sonntag" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine "Spiegel" and broadcaster "ARD," Obama said: "She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important." "I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner." Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states. " 

},{"Generated text": " NFL, Ravens to play in Super Bowl The NFL and the National Football League have agreed to host Sunday's game at Wembley Stadium in London. President Donald Trump and NFL owner Robert Kraft are expected to attend the game. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is scheduled to speak to the media on Sunday morning at the White House in Washington, D.C. The two-time defending champions of the NFL, the Baltimore Ravens, will play the London-based Jacksonsville Jaguars in the national championship game, which kicks off at 7:30 p.m. (ET). The game will be televised live on NBC, with a kickoff time of 1:15 and a halftime show of "Star Spangled Banner." NFL owners Kraft, owner Shahid Khan and Goodell will also attend, along with the team's general manager, Steve Bisciotti. "We're going to have a great game," Kraft said in a statement, adding that he was "very excited" to be a part of a "great game." "I'm very proud of our team," he said. But he added that the Ravens would not be able to do it without the support of their owner, chairman and CEO, NFL President and Co-Chairman, President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has called for a boycott of all NFL games this year, said he "wouldn't be happy" if the league did not allow the protests to continue. He also said that NFL players should be allowed to protest during the anthem, saying it was disrespectful to African Americans and their rights to express their views on the flag and national anthem. In addition, Goodell said, "The NFL has a lot of respect for our players and our fans, and we will continue to stand with them as we have for the past four years." Trump's visit to London comes a day after the US presidential election, in which the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a resolution calling for President Trump to step down from his post as US president. During his speech, Trump said: "It's time for us to take a stand and stand up for what we believe in and what our country stands for." The president also spoke about the importance of unity in sports, noting that it is important to unite the country in order to win the next two elections. It's a message that has resonated with many people across the political spectrum, including many Republicans and some Democrats who have criticized the president's decision to withdraw from the race-baiting presidential race. And it's not just about football, either. There's also the issue of race and ethnicity, as well as the lack of diversity in American politics. We're talking about race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, all of those kinds of things. I don't think we've ever seen that before. That's why I'm so excited about this game and I hope that we'll see it again next year," Trump told the crowd. 'We've got to get back to our roots' The anthem has been a staple of US politics since the 1960s, when President George W. Bush was the first president to address the nation at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama. Since then, it has become a rallying cry for millions of Americans, especially young people, to show their support for their country and to make it a better place to live, work and play. Last year's election was a referendum on whether or not Trump would be re-elected to a second four-year term in office. On Sunday, he announced he would run for president again in 2020, but he didn't rule out the possibility of running for another three years. What's more, though, is that Trump will have to decide whether he wants to run again or stay in his current job as a Republican. If he doesn't, what's next for him? In the meantime, there's always the question of who will take over the role of head of football operations in this country. Who will win? Who is the most important player in football? The question is: Who does he want to replace? I think the answer is a combination of politics and sportsmanship. You can't just say, 'Well, we're not going anywhere,' but you can certainly say that's the case with football," said Trump during a press conference in New York, where he met with NFL commissioner Don McGahn and other officials from both parties.

,"Reference text": " NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players "took a knee" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars (840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: "If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!" "NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US," he added. Later, the president said that his rant "has nothing to do with race," despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about "respect for our country and respect for our flag." Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as "sons of bitches." "Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he "100 percent" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to "peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful," and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. "Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal," he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

"There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we've experienced over the last month." Denouncing Trump's remarks, Goodell said: "Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities." But Trump hit back later on Sunday at a worsening furore, saying the row "has nothing to do with race." Instead, he said: "This has to do with respect for our country, and respect for our flag." At least seven NFL team owners donated at least $1 million each to Trump's presidential campaign last year. They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers " 

},{"Generated text": " Buchenwald: The history of the Nazi concentration camp in Weimar, Germany, is being told. Historians say it's the most important site in the world where the Holocaust took place. In July, 1937, Adolf Hitler was sentenced to life in prison for the crimes committed during the war. He was the first person to be executed by the Nazis for his crimes. According to historian Volkhard Knigge, the sentence was handed down by a judge. The sentence, which was later reduced to one year, was a death sentence for all those who committed crimes against humanity. It was also the last time that a German citizen would receive a sentence of life imprisonment. "It's a sad day," said Ronald Hirte, a historian at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. But he's not the only one who has suffered from the horrors of war and persecution. There are many others who have suffered the same fate. Many of them are still alive today, and many more who are suffering from mental illness or are in need of medical attention. These are the people who died in concentration camps in Europe and the USA, as well as the millions of Jews who perished in those camps. Some of these people are Jews, while others are Roma or Sinti. They have been persecuted and persecuted for their faith, but they have never been able to escape the persecution of their religion. This is the result of a series of events that led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom were forced to flee their homes in order to seek refuge in other countries. Author: Cornelia Rabitz / gsw Editor: Gabriel Borrud These events are part of an ongoing debate about the fate of Germany's Jewish population and whether it should be allowed to return to its former glory or not. At the beginning of World War II, Jews were persecuted in Hungary, Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia. Today, they are persecuted by their own government, with the exception of one exception: the Jehovah's Witnesses in South Africa. Since the GDR was founded in 1945, there has been a steady stream of Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Central and Eastern Europe. However, since the end of that era, it has become increasingly difficult for Jews to come back to their homeland. For example, in Poland, where there are over 1,000 Jews living in exile, thousands have fled to neighboring countries in search of safety and security. Now there is a new wave of refugees from outside the country. A new generation of migrants is coming to Germany and they will have to make do with what they can find: a better life for themselves and their families. Human rights groups are calling for an end to discrimination against Jews and other minorities in society, including the Roma, who now live in overcrowded camps and have no access to medical care and education. What is more difficult is to find a place for them to live and work in a country where they don't have the means to do so. As a result, most Jews are unable to leave their home countries, so they stay in their native countries and do not go to school. That's why the German Armed Forces have a very difficult time dealing with these problems, because they're not equipped to deal with them at all. Even in our own country, we can't do much about it. We can only do a lot of things that are difficult, such as education, employment, health care, housing, transportation, education and so on. And we cannot do it without the help of other people. So we need to get rid of some of our old enemies and bring back the old ones. Right now we have only a handful of new ones, like the Germans who came to our country in 1937 and 1938, when they were still fighting the Soviet Union. Those who were left behind were the ones who had to give up their lives to fight the Soviets. Only a few hundred people still live on the streets of Berlin today and that's enough for me to say: "I'm glad you're here. I hope you've made it through this difficult period of time." In the 1950s and 1960s, people from all over Europe began to feel that they had a right to a life of freedom, even if they didn't want to. Then in 1950, after the fall of Yugoslavia, things started to change. More and more people started coming back from other places. Most of those people were Jewish, although there were some exceptions to this rule. Among them were a number of Roma and some Jews from Hungary who lived in camps that were not so far away from our borders. "
,"Reference text": " Buchenwald: Lessons from past and present 75 years ago in July, 1937, the concentration camp Buchenwald was built near the city of Weimar. The memorial there today draws people from around the world, and its program has seen some shifts in recent years. Once a favorite area for hiking and vacationing, Buchenwald was transformed in 1937 into a site designed to annihilate people. Beyond clusters of trees, a valley opens up, dotted today by one or two villages. Back then, the cold and windy north side of the valley was set aside for Buchenwald's prisoners, and the more comfortable climate on the southern side was reserved for the guards and camp directors. An open secret "The camp was no secret," noted historian Ronald Hirte during a visit to the grounds. Everyone could have seen Buchenwald from below, he said, because the surrounding forest was not as thick as it is today. Buchenwald was situated about five kilometers (3 miles) from the city of Weimar. Among local residents, its existence was an uncomfortable fact. The concentration camp was a place of horrors that people in the cultural and political focal point of Weimar wanted to know nothing about. "But many local companies did very well thanks to the work of the prisoners," Hirte said. Thousands of people from throughout Europe were deported to the camp beginning in 1937, and they were forced to march from Weimar to Buchenwald. Later the city was connected with the camp by a railway built by the prisoners, who also built a service road still called today by its original name: Blutstraße - literally, Blood Street.On a now barren and empty spot on the hill, prisoners had to gather each morning and night for a role call that could last hours. A gateway bearing the words "Jedem das Seine" (Translated literally: "To each his own," but figuratively: "Everyone will get what he deserves.") still stands, along with bunkers and the dark and musty rooms in which Nazi guards tortured and murdered the prisoners. Bringing the present into focus It is not uncommon for 20 groups of young people to visit the memorial on a given day. "Interest continues to grow, and so does the number of visitors," said Hirte. It is now Germany's third and fourth post-war generations that can come to ask questions here and learn what happened. The memorial offers a wide-ranging educational program. But the point is not to moralize and point fingers into the past, said the director of the memorial, Volkhard Knigge: "We want to direct questions of contemporary society toward the past." More concretely, that means that issues including human rights violations, persecution, right-wing extremism and nationalism are taken up as contemporary topics against the historical background of the Holocaust. "Today, that is our central historical, political, and ethical educational task," Knigge said. During a recent visit, two 14-year-old boys sat in front of a plaque listing the home countries of former prisoners. "We are here with our school, and our teacher just showed us around. Now we have a couple of assignments to do - for example, finding out where the prisoners were from and how many lived here," one boy explained. Watching them, it is apparent that this is not just a routine field trip. There is a bit of horsing around when the school groups first arrive, but silence and solemnity are the norm once students pass by the execution chambers and furnaces used to incinerate bodies. There are also groups from Poland, Russia and the USA in attendance. One American student relates that her grandfather was among those who helped liberate Buchenwald but that he never spoke about the experience. No "trite effects" Addressing questions about what should be shown today, how the site should be commentated, what is authentic and credible - and what isn't - forms the core of the work done by the memorial's team. The administration has generally tried to avoid reconstructing what Buchenwald might have been like. "We don't want to create any trite effects," said Ronald Hirte. "The noisiness and narrowness of this place, how terrible the smell was - we could never convey that to visitors today anyway." The memorial's head said that Buchenwald has become a model for other countries around the world - in a partnership sense rather than in a presumptuous way. "Everywhere in the world, in South America, Rwanda, South Africa, Hungary, in the former Yugoslavia, there are people examining and dealing with their history. We support and encourage them in their search for ways to honor and respect victims without concealing the horrors of what happened," he said. Asking why In recent years, other less visible groups have been added to the list of those memorialized. Alongside Jewish victims, politically persecuted individuals of various nationalities, Soviet prisoners of war and Roma and Sinti people, the grounds now also house memorials "

The German government warned on Thursday that Turkey would be unable to deal with a crisis that has gripped Europe since the start of the year. Germany, the European Union's largest trading partner, said it would not take any action against Turkey until the situation in Greece was resolved. "We are not going to allow Turkey to continue to operate in this way," German Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said at a news conference in Brussels, adding that the EU would take action if Turkey failed to respond quickly enough. Turkey, which has been accused of supporting the Syrian government in its fight against the Islamic State (IS) in neighboring Syria, has denied any involvement in the conflict. In a statement, Turkey's foreign minister said the country would continue its cooperation with EU member states, including Greece and Turkey. However, he also warned that "it will take some time" before a deal could be reached between Ankara and Ankara. German officials said they were not aware of any imminent threat to Europe from Turkey or Greece, but that they had been informed by the Turkish government of a possible military solution to the problem. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey had "no choice" but to accept the solution. He also called on European countries to cooperate with Turkey on the issue of border security, saying it was "a matter of mutual concern" for the security of European citizens and the interests of EU states. European states have also expressed concern over the Greek crisis and called for an immediate halt to Turkish military operations in Syria. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)The EU's border agency, Frontex, announced it had decided to send a combat support ship "Bonn" into the Mediterranean to assist Turkey in securing its border with Greece. It is the first time that Germany has agreed to provide military support to Greece in an attempt to prevent the spread of IS across the continent. EU countries are also expected to contribute more than $3.2 billion (3 billion-euro) to combat the threat posed by Turkey and its allies, according to a draft EU-Turkey agreement signed last week by EU and NATO leaders. Europe is also due to receive a total of 3 billion euros in additional military aid from the United States, Germany and Denmark, as well as a further 1.5 billion from Italy, France and Germany. Both countries have expressed their concern about the impact of Turkish actions on their own borders, with Germany calling for a "total and complete withdrawal of all Turkish troops from Syria." The EU has also asked the US and France to step up their cooperation in fighting IS in a bid to stem the flow of refugees and migrants into Europe. Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said a US-led coalition of NATO countries would provide "technical assistance" to Turkey as part of its efforts to secure the border between Syria and neighboring countries in order to contain the influx of migrants and refugees entering the bloc. NATO said on Wednesday that NATO would also provide logistical support for Turkey if necessary, although it did not specify how many troops would need to be deployed. According to an EU official, "NATO will provide technical assistance and technical support if needed." NATO has already announced a number of measures to help Turkey secure its borders. But it is not clear how much of these measures will be implemented, and it has not yet been decided whether or not the alliance will implement them, or whether they will remain in place for longer than the current period. Some EU leaders have already expressed concerns about Turkey using its military might to fight IS, while others have voiced concerns over its possible use of chemical weapons against its own citizens. Others have suggested Turkey could use the military as an instrument to deter IS from entering Europe's borders and to try to stop IS militants from crossing into its territory. They have not said whether Turkey is prepared to use its armed forces against IS or if they are ready to take part in any sort of counter-terrorism operation. Neither has Turkey indicated whether it wants to do so. "
,"Reference text": " Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. "It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats," the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship "Bonn." Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters) "

Kerry's visit to Cairo comes a day after the US announced that it would travel to Egypt next week to attend a meeting of the UN Security Council. The US and Egypt have been at loggerheads over the Gaza crisis since Sunday, when Israel fired rockets into the Palestinian territory, killing at least seven people and wounding more than 100. Israel has accused Egypt of supporting Hamas, which has claimed responsibility for the attack. Egypt has denied the accusations, saying it was an act of terrorism. "We have no evidence that Hamas is behind this attack," US ambassador Ron Prosor said in a statement. US President Barack Obama said on Sunday that he was "deeply concerned" by Israel's actions, adding that "it is clear that there is no justification for this act." Kerry also said that Israel would continue to cooperate with Egypt in its efforts to resolve the crisis. He said the United States and Israel had agreed to hold talks in Cairo in the coming days to try to reach an agreement on the fate of Gaza's Hamas rulers, who have called for an end to the blockade. Israeli officials have said they have not yet reached a deal with Hamas and that the group is not planning to return to Gaza until the end of this month. A US official told the Washington Post that US officials were "very concerned about the possibility of an escalation of tensions between Israel and Hamas." US State Department spokesman Sean Carmeli told reporters that Kerry had spoken to Israeli Defense Force commander Eugene Richard Gasana, a Rwandan who was killed in an Israeli airstrike last week. hc/dr (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)In an interview with the New York Times, Kerry said he had "no doubt" that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas would attend the meeting. However, he did not say whether the talks would take place at the same time as the Israeli-Egyptian peace talks, or if the two sides would discuss a possible peace deal. On Monday, the White House said Kerry would be in Egypt for talks on a peace agreement, but that they would not be able to proceed because of a lack of coordination between Israeli and Palestinian forces. It was not immediately clear whether Kerry was referring to Hamas as a terrorist organization or not, according to a spokesperson for US national security adviser Jen Psaki. Last week, US Ambassador to Israel, Max Steinberg, also spoke out against the ceasefire, calling it a "violation of international humanitarian law." "It is a violation of human rights and international law," he said. In a separate statement, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel was committed to ending the truce, "but we are not going to allow it to be implemented without a precondition." Lieberman also called on Hamas to cease its attacks on Israel. According to Lieberman and Lieberman, Hamas has repeatedly threatened to launch attacks against Israel if Israel does not halt its military operations. Lieberman's comments came as Israel sought to reassure the international community that a ceasefire was in place, despite the fact that Israeli forces were not ready to give up their ground troops to defend the territory. But Lieberman refused to back down on that claim, telling reporters: "I don't think that's the case. I think it's a matter of time before we have a chance to make a decision." The Israeli military has said it is prepared to resume its offensive against Hamas if Hamas fails to comply with its demands for a cease-fire. Meanwhile, Netanyahu's government has been accused of trying to undermine the peace process by accusing Hamas of being a terror organization. Hamas denies the allegations, however, and says it has no intention of doing so. During the first round of talks with Israel on July 8, Israel said Hamas was responsible for all the attacks, including those carried out by the terror group. Netanyahu has also accused the Palestinians of using chemical weapons against civilians, accusing them of carrying out attacks in self-defense. While Israel denies this accusation, Lieberman has not said whether he would accept a truce. "

Israel's army said several militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: "Those rumurs are untrue." US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends.

},{"Generated text": " Bashar Assad and Turkey in Syria The Turkish government has accused Syrian President Bashar Assad of using chemical weapons against his own people. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denied the accusations, saying that the Syrian regime was responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians in the war-torn country. According to a report by the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (DIY) on Wednesday, the allegations were made by Amnesty International, which said that Assad's regime had used chemical agents against civilians. DW spoke to Turkish Foreign Minister Volker Perthes, who said he was "deeply concerned" about the Turkish accusations. "I am deeply concerned," he told DW, adding that Turkey's accusations were "completely unfounded." "We have no reason to believe that this is the case. We do not have the facts to prove that it was the Assad regime that caused the death of hundreds of innocent civilians, and that there was no evidence to support these allegations." The accusations against Assad are not new. In fact, they are part of a broader pattern that has emerged in recent years. The Syrian government, for example, has been accused of supporting the regime of President Assad in its fight against terrorism. However, there is no proof that these accusations have been substantiated. There are also allegations that Russia, Turkey and Iran are behind the attacks, as well as that some of these attacks were carried out by pro-Assad forces. This is not the first time that such allegations have come to light. On the other hand, it is also the latest in a series of accusations that have surfaced against the president and his regime. Author: Ruth Jüttner, DW Editor-in-Chief, Middle East Policy The latest accusations come as the government of Prime Minister Guido Westerwelle of Germany has called for a "total and complete withdrawal of all Syrian forces from Syria." Germany's foreign minister has also called on Turkey to withdraw its troops from the conflict-ravaged country, accusing Turkey of "hostile acts" and "aggravated attacks on civilians." In a statement issued on Tuesday, German foreign ministry spokesman Volk Westerfeldt said Turkey had "no reason" to pull out of Syria. He added that "Turkey does not want to take part in any kind of military action against Syria, but it has the right to do so." But he also stressed the need for an end to the "war on terror," which he called "a total and total failure of the international community to act in accordance with international law and the rule of law." He also pointed out that, in addition to fighting terrorism, Syria also faces a number of other crises, including the civil war in Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Lebanon. And, he said, "Syria is a very complex and complex situation, with a lot of challenges and challenges to overcome." DW also asked whether Turkey would be willing to step up its support for Syria's government in order to prevent the country from falling into the hands of its own enemies. Do you think Turkey is ready to give up on Syria? The question is whether it will be able to provide the necessary political and economic support? DW: The answer is "yes," but I don't think so. I think it's too early to say for sure. What I do know is that if Turkey does decide to intervene militarily, then the situation is going to be very difficult. It will have to wait and see how long it takes before it can be implemented. But I'm not sure what will happen to Turkey. If it doesn't take action, we will see what happens. That's why we are talking about Syria right now, because we have a situation in which there are no other options. So far, so good, that's the only way to deal with it. How long will it take for Assad to get out? It depends on how much time he has left before he can get back on the road to Damascus. At the moment, Assad is still holding on to his position as head of state, despite the fact that he is currently fighting a war against a Turkish-backed regime in northern Syria that is backed by Russia.

,"Reference text": " A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, "Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria." Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: "Assad has no interest in an escalation," he told DW. "That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory." Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. "That would only accelerate the fall of his regime," he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a "tragic accident." Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. "Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict," said Perthes. "It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition." NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its "flagrant violations of international law." Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. "We call on all parties to show great discretion," she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, "The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad." Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth Jüttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. "It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children," she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, "It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now." "

The UN said on Friday that the North African country was in "grave danger" after a group of Islamist militants seized a NATO-backed government building in Libya's eastern city of Tobruk. Dozens of people were killed and more than 100 wounded in fighting between rival factions, according to the UN. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the group, Fajr Libya, claimed responsibility for the attack, adding that it was the first time it had taken place outside of Geneva. "We are in grave danger," he said in a statement. He added that there was no evidence that any of the attackers had been killed or that they were planning to take over the government buildings in Tripoli. A UN report released Friday said that a total of 10,000 people, including civilians, were believed to have been taken hostage by the Islamists, and that some of them had fled to neighboring countries to escape the violence. In Geneva, a UN peacekeeping mission has been set up to monitor the situation, but it is not yet clear whether it will be able to carry out its mission without the help of international forces. At the same time, UN officials have said they have not seen any evidence of any imminent attacks. They have also said there are no indications that armed groups are planning attacks on UN missions in eastern Libya. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters) - type-of-liquids, or "terrorists," as they are known to be known - said UN special envoy for Libya Abdullah al-Thinni, who heads the GNC intelligence agency, told the Geneva-based organization that he was "very concerned" about a possible attack by Islamist groups in western Libya that could lead to a "total and complete destruction of our country." He said he did not see any reason to believe that such an attack would be carried out by a terrorist organization, which he described as an "extremist" organization. Is it possible that this could be the result of a failed attempt to overthrow the Libyan government in 2011, when Gadhafi was overthrown by pro-Western forces? es-bkw (AFP, AP, CBS) – or is it the "Islamic State" (IS, formerly known as the Nusra Front) that has seized the capital, Tripoli, in recent weeks? Is there any chance of this happening again, he added? "I don't think so. I think there is a very good chance that we will have a situation where we have to deal with this situation," said Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, the head of Libya’s state-run intelligence service, at a news conference in Switzerland on Saturday. His comments came amid growing international concern about the role of Islamic State in Libyan politics and the threat posed by an armed group that seeks to topple the internationally-recognized government of former dictator Moammar Gaddafi. It is unclear whether the jihadist group has any ties to NATO or the United States, although it has said it does not want to cooperate with NATO in its efforts to oust the regime. If so, what role does it play in this conflict? The Geneva meeting is the second in as many days in which UN Special Rapporteur General Ban Ki-moon is due to travel to Libya to meet with the president and prime minister, as well as other members of his government and cabinet, to discuss the future of NATO's mission there. There is no immediate word yet on whether he will attend the meeting, however, because he has not been invited to participate in it so far. But he is expected to attend it on Sunday. What is certain is that if he does attend, there will not be a meeting between the two sides. After all, Libya is an unstable country with a lot of instability and a number of terrorist organizations operating within its borders, many of which are affiliated with al Qaeda and other extremist groups, such as IS and Al-Shabaab. However, some observers say that is unlikely to happen, given the fact that Libya has a strong military and political system and is relatively stable. "

The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to "a ceasefire on all fronts," according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that "the other parties respect the truce." The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on "confidence-building measures," which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters) "

The French Republican candidate is facing a tough fight in his home state of Ludwigsburg. France's far-right National Front (FN) candidate has faced an uphill battle to become the next president of the European Union (EU). The FN candidate, who was elected to the French parliament in May, faces a difficult task in the first round of voting on Sunday. French voters will have to decide whether or not to vote for him or whether they want him to run for re-election next year, according to Henrik Uterwedde, a political scientist at the German-French Institute for Policy Studies (GPS). "It's a very difficult decision," he told rbb-Inforadio. "But it's the right thing to do. It's not just a question of who is going to win the election, but who will win it." "I don't think there will be a lot of candidates who can win," said Andreas Jung, head of Germany's Bundesbundestag, which represents the country's Republican and Republican parties. He added that there was a "very good chance" that the FN would be able to secure a majority of seats in parliament, and that it would have a strong chance of winning the general election. However, he added, "There are a number of people who would like to see a change of government," and said that he was not sure how many people would want to be part of that change. In the end, it was all about the candidates themselves, not the party itself. There were a few exceptions, however, such as the fact that FN candidates are not allowed to take part in elections in other European countries. And there were also a couple of exceptions. For example, in Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister of Britain at that time. David Rachline, the Republican Party's chairman, said he didn't see any reason why she should not be elected. But he did see the possibility that she could win a second term, because she is a member of parliament and she has the experience of being elected in her own right. She is also the daughter of a British politician who has been in politics for more than 30 years. Rival candidates for French and German elections are also expected to form a coalition government, with the Greens and the Socialists in particular being the most likely candidates. On the other hand, there is no clear frontrunner in French elections, as far as France is concerned, for the far right is the only party that has a chance to make it to a third round. That is, if it can get the votes it needs. So far, only two candidates have made it into the final round and they are far from certain that they will get it. One of them, Marine le Pen, is far more likely than the others to get a fourth term. If she wins, she will face a stiff challenge from the left-of-centre (Fillon), who could face an even stiffer challenge if she does not secure the support of her party's parliamentary majority. This could be the result of an anti-EU vote, or a combination of both. Both candidates would face stiff opposition from within their own party and within the ranks of their respective political parties, especially if they do not have enough votes to pass a referendum on the EU's membership. At the same time, they would also face the prospect of losing the popular vote in an election that could give them an edge in opinion polls. They would need to convince voters that their vote is too important to them to back down from their current position. As a result, French politicians are increasingly turning to their party leaders for support, even if that means voting for a candidate who doesn't have the backing of most voters. Many of those who have voted for them have been disillusioned by the current political climate and are looking for an alternative candidate to replace them. Some of these voters, like former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, have even expressed their support for her on social media. Others, though, are more sceptical. "

Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the "National Front" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. "For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears," said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. "Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer." In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the "forgotten France," regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. "Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen," Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. "He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot." 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. "Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem," Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. "He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front." Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. "Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France," said Uterwedde. "Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. "Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism," David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. "Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate," said France expert Uterwedde. "And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course." " 

},{"Generated text": " Vienna's Environmental Health Specialist Mia Landauer explains how the temperature in Vienna can affect the health of the environment. "It's like living in a greenhouse," she says. Environmental health specialists from the Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IASA) say the temperatures in the Vienna Woods are comparable to those in Europe. In fact, they're comparable in temperature to that in other parts of Europe, where temperatures can be as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in some places. But in Austria, temperatures are much higher, with the exception of Vienna, which has the highest temperature of any major European city. This is due to the fact that Vienna has a high degree of climate change, and that's because it's a very hot and humid climate. The temperature is also very low in many places, such as the city, the countryside and the mountains. It's also because of this high temperature that the air quality is so poor, that people can't breathe properly. So, in order to maintain a healthy temperature, you need to be able to breathe in and out of your body temperature. That's why you have to have a roof over your head, because you don't want to inhale the heat. And that is what we're doing here. We're trying to get rid of all the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, so that we can breathe more air into our bodies and our brains. Our goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the quality of life for our people and for the planet.   In other words, we are going to make sure that our environment is clean and healthy and we have the best possible environment for people to live in. I think we've got a pretty good chance of that happening, but we'll see what happens when we do that. What do you think will happen if we make it to a certain temperature? What will you do with all this heat and humidity? We'll try to figure out what will be the most efficient way to deal with it. If you're a scientist, then you know that you'll be doing a lot of research. You'll find lots of interesting things to do. For example, if you look at the thermometer readings, it shows that there is a large amount of heat being generated by the heating system. Then you can use that heat to cool down the atmosphere and reduce the carbon dioxide levels in your atmosphere. Or you could use it as an energy source and heat it up to 100 times more efficiently than if it were stored in an airtight container. All of these factors are very important for us to understand and understand the environmental health effects of our climate, as well as our ability to cope with heat, humidity, temperature and air pollution. There are a number of factors that contribute to this. One of them is that it is very difficult to know what the climate is like when you are in high temperatures. Another factor is how much heat is being stored and how it affects your health. As a result, people are more likely to die from heat exposure than when they were in their 20s or 30s. These factors can lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other diseases, among other things. At the same time, there are many other factors which are contributing to these problems, like the high heat index and high humidity levels that are associated with high-temperature environments. Some of those factors may also be linked to climate changes. Climate change is an important factor in determining the degree to which temperature rises and falls, for instance, when it comes to energy consumption. However, this is not the only factor that contributes to temperature rise. Temperature rises are also a key factor for determining whether or not temperatures rise or fall. Therefore, heat rises or falls are important factors to consider when making decisions about how long it will take to achieve the desired result of a temperature increase. Above all, climate models predict that temperatures will continue to rise gradually over the next few years, especially if they are high enough to reach the ideal temperature for a long time. "
,"Reference text": " Keeping cool on Europe's urban heat islands Due to the drought in Europe, Austria experienced a particularly hot summer this year. Urban areas run warmer due to the heat island effect - and as the climate heats up, cities like Vienna are tackling this problem. Europe was hit by drought this summer, with parts of the continent experiencing the longest and hottest heat waves on record. In the Austrian capital of Vienna, temperatures were well above the summer average - and stayed there for weeks on end. This summer, the city recorded the most days over 35 degrees Celsius - including its hottest-ever night temperature - and medical calls rose by 20 percent. Environmental health specialist Hans-Peter Hutter says that on particularly calm, hot days, recommended public health limits for ozone were are significantly exceeded. And it's not just people with allergies and other conditions who suffer. "We know that in these acute periods, unfortunately, people will die," he says. The heat is becoming such an issue that the government has resolved to tackle what is known as the urban heat island effect. Like most cities, Vienna is hotter than its surrounding areas as a result of humans having altered the landscape, covering the earth with heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete. The phenomenon was first described more than two centuries ago - but global warming and industrialization are pushing it to new extremes. "The densely built-up parts of the city can be 4, 5, up to 10 degrees [Celsius] warmer than the surroundings," says Christian Härtel, an expert in building and planning who is researching this effect and its causes for Vienna's environmental protection department. More green roofs, less air-con There are many reasons for the dramatic temperature differentials between city and countryside. Fresh air and wind don't circulate as freely through cities. Colors and materials play a role too, with dark surfaces absorbing more heat than lighter ones. And due to the sealing over of soils, urban landscapes retain less moisture than natural ones. Up on the roof terrace of the city block where he works, Härtel points to two different roof types. "One is a pebble roof - when the sun shines it gets very hot," Härtel says. "On the other there is a colorful garden with a variety of herbs - I can see mint and over there, sage, chives, we have a water surface and a terraced area. It's a garden in the city," he points out. Vienna's city administration wants many more green roofs on buildings and residential blocks. As global temperatures rise, says Härtel, the need for natural methods to keep cities cool is becoming more urgent. Otherwise, artificial methods result in a negative feedback effect. "It's getting hotter, and so we cool our living spaces by consuming fossil fuels - and so we are then making this hothouse effect even worse," Härtel explains. Pocket parks Vienna's imperial past has left a legacy of grand parks and open spaces. Once, only royalty could kick up their heels in these pleasant grounds. But now, they provide a welcome haven for all the city's residents to literally chill out when temperatures rise. "Vienna has had luck with the empire times, because these places became protected," says Mia Landauer as she strolls through one such grand park beside her office at the Institute for Applied Systems Analysis to the south of Vienna, where she works as a research scholar on climate governance. The city is also fringed by the Vienna Woods on its northern side. Landauer sees this as an asset that mitigates the urban heat island effect. “We might have lost the Vienna Woods many times - but because of this history of Vienna, they realized that it is important to have this much green space in a city." Like in most cities, Vienna's population is growing rapidly, driven partly by immigration and partly by lack of jobs in rural areas. So does that mean the urban island will become even hotter as the city grows? Landauer says this need not be the case - but "the pressure is on" because of climate change. That pressure comes from the conflict between the need for green spaces, and the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing commuting distances through more dense urban living. Landauer believes "pocket parks" could provide a solution. "That means parks like any park, but of a very small size," she says. It's been demonstrated that in dense urban environments, even small parks can reduce the urban heat island effect. Landauer says these tiny green spaces also reduce flooding by absorbing water, and preventing the overflow of drains and sewers. Not to mention added benefits in terms of quality of life and enjoyment for residents with access to these parks. Cool cities make the most of rainwater While new buildings can be designed with green walls and roofs, it's more difficult to reduce heat in older areas of the city. In Vienna's 5th district most buildings are at least 100 years old, and there are few parks. But a new system could use rainwater to cool this dense urban environment " 

},{"Generated text": " Jochen Langer: 'Al Qaeda is a terrorist organization' In Syria, Jihadists are fighting for control of the country's borders. They are trying to overthrow the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, who has ruled Syria for more than two decades. The jihadists are seeking to establish a caliphate in Syria and the Middle East. In the past few months, they have been fighting in the Syrian capital, Damascus, with the aim of establishing an Islamic state. But in April, the jihadists launched an attack on a Syrian army base in Ma'loula, killing at least 40 people and wounding dozens more, according to a report by the Lebanese-German-based International Society for Human Rights (ISHR). The attack was carried out by al Qaeda's "Islamic State" (Isis) affiliate, which has claimed responsibility for the attack. It is believed that the jihadist group has been planning attacks on Syrian government forces for some time, and that they are planning to launch a counteroffensive against the government in Damascus. However, it is not clear how long this plan will last. According to ISHR, Gazouhas is one of a number of jihadists who have taken to the Internet to spread their message. He is also a member of an Islamist organization called "Al-Qusayr," which claims to be fighting alongside the Assad regime. "It is an organization that is fighting against Assad's regime," he told DW, adding that he had no idea what the group was calling for. 'We are not going to allow this to happen. We will not let this happen to us.' The Syrian National Council (SNC), which is the umbrella organization of Syrian opposition groups, was founded by Jean Kawak, a former minister of foreign affairs and foreign policy at the German Foreign Office (FDA). It was created to counter the influence of radical Islamists, including the so-called "Nusra Front." The organization is based in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, where it has a population of around 1.5 million people. On the streets of Aleppo there are hundreds of mosques, churches, schools, mosques and other places of worship. Many of these mosques are located on the outskirts of Damascus and are frequented by radical Islamist groups. There are also mosques in other parts of Syria. Some of them have a large presence in towns and villages, as well as large numbers of people who don't belong to any particular religious sect or denomination. These are the places where the jihadis are most active. This is why we have seen so many attacks in recent months. And we are seeing a lot of violence in these areas, especially in northern Syria," said Sadiq Al-Mousslie from the Swedish-Swedish-language NGO, "Amnesty International" in an interview with DW. At the same time as the attacks, there has also been an increase in violence against Syrian Christians in Turkey and across the region, he added, saying that there is "a new wave of terrorism" that has taken hold in this country. As a result, more and more people are being killed and displaced. That has led to increased violence and a rise in suicide bombings and suicide attacks. So far, however, no one is seriously injured or killed, but the violence has continued unabated. Most of those who are killed or injured have suffered from a lack of medical care and treatment. What is most worrying is that these attacks have spread to other countries, such as Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Europe and even the United States. All of this is happening in a very different way from what we saw in Iraq and Syria during the war in 2011, when the Islamic State (ISIS) was able to take over the entire country and spread its ideology and ideology. I think that's a good thing, because it's something that we can all see in our daily lives, even if we're not the only ones who see it as a threat to our own country." But what about the fight against terrorism? Is there a fight for freedom of speech and expression? "I think we need to talk about this in order to get the message out there that this isn't just a war of words between the two sides," says Jean-Kawak from Amnesty International's Syria office in Beirut. "
,"Reference text": " Syria's Christians flee rebel crosshairs Groups of Jihadists are increasingly targeting Christian communities, lumping them together as "pro Assad." More than a third of Christians have fled. Some worry about the future of Christianity in the country. In the days after a sharpshooter put his brother in the crosshairs and pulled the trigger, Jalal Gazouha lived as if in a cloud. "I almost went crazy with grief," the Syrian explained on the telephone. The connection crackles. The 29-year-old's brother was killed by al Qaeda fighters in the western Syrian city of al-Qusayr, close to the Lebanese border. Gazouha is convinced that his brother was killed because he was Christian. "They want to drive us out of Syria," he told DW. By "they," he's referring to Jihadists from countries neighboring Syria - with a few hundred from Germany mixed in - who have joined in the Syrian civil war to fight against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. According to Gazouha, they're also targeting Christians. Twenty of his family members have been murdered, he says. When Gazouha received death threats, he fled the country. "I saw my name on a list on the Internet. That list contained names of Christians who were supposed to be killed, he says, written by "the terrorists of al Qaeda." Jean Kawak, a Syriac bishop from Damascus, chose his words carefully when he spoke about the subject with DW. "We Christians have recently felt threatened by particular radical Islamist groups," he said. Kawak's own sister was forced to flee Ma'loula, a small, largely Christian village just an hour's drive north of Damascus. Islamist rebel groups attacked that village, carried out fire attacks on two churches in Rakka in north central Syria and also kidnapped two Syrian bishops in April; the culprits behind the latter attack, eyewitnesses said, were foreign Jihadists. All of these things, the Aramaic bishop says, "affect our Christian presence within Syria." One-third of Christians have fled the country in the last two years due to the civil war - with numbers increasing. These radicalized groups are not only targeting Christians though, Kawak says. "Moderate Muslims are also being threatened." Fears of displacement Kawak fears that Christian refugees may not be able to return at war's end - something comparable, he says, to what happened in southern Turkey. "Christianity has been there for 2,000 years. And we hope that Christianity is not going to leave that area." To prevent that, Kawak traveled from Damascus to Europe for a short trip. He met with Swedish politicians, German aid organization employees as well as members of Germany's Foreign Office, showing statistics related to refugees and handing out so many business cards that he had none left by the time of the interview with DW. His goal? More humanitarian aid for people in Syria - but also a political solution to the conflict. The West must do more, he says, to bring both sides to the negotiating table. "Reconciliation is possible," says Kawak - of that he is convinced. But what kind of reconciliation could be possible between Bashar al-Assad and the rebels, the latter of whom have rejected any form of political solution that leaves Assad in power? The bishop shakes his head. "You can't make demands before you begin negotiations. A real dialogue has to take place without preconditions," he said. Otherwise, the bishop worries, murders and tit-for-tat attacks will continue for years - perhaps decades - with an unforeseeable end for Syria's Christians. Praying for peace Jochen Langer, Middle East expert at the International Society for Human Rights, shares the bishop's concerns. "The Syrian army is trying, as well as they can, to protect Syria's Christians," he told DW. "But that's only possible to a limited extent." Lately, the regime has been hard-pressed to secure any single area within Syria. Daily, sometimes hourly, the fronts between rebel forces and the Syrian army change. Christians are in particular danger, Langer says, "when they, wherever they live, end up between the fighting." In other words, Christians, like all Syrians, die from the bombs and grenades that land in their villages and cities. In some regions, Langer says, Christians have already been singled out, often by the Islamist al-Nusra Front, a group moderate opposition forces have no control over. But the expert also added that "those could also be very personal acts of rage." Sadiq Al-Mousslie, a member of the Syrian National Council in Germany that forms part of the Syrian National Coalition, acknowledges that there were cases of "sporadic attacks by sick individuals." But were they targeted attacks? "No," he says firmly. "That's part of the Assad regime's propaganda that's been taken up by the West." Behind it, he says, is the regime "

The court ruled that the company should be allowed to sell its products in Germany. A Berlin court on Tuesday ruled against Google, which has been accused of violating the German constitution by selling its street view technology to the public. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for Google to be banned from selling the technology in the country. Germany's highest court, the Berlin State Supreme Court, ruled Tuesday that Google should not sell the product to anyone who wants to buy it. "We have a duty to protect the privacy and security of our citizens," said Peter Fleischer, a Google employee in Berlin. He said the court's ruling was "a clear signal that we are not going to allow the sale of this technology." The ruling comes after a court in November 2010 found that German authorities had failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify the use of the tech. According to Thomas Hören, head of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, Google was unable to prove that it had violated the constitution. However, he told Deutsche Welle in an interview that he believed the decision was made "in accordance with the law." "Google is not a company that sells street views," he said, adding that "the company does not have the legal authority to do so." He also pointed out that there was no legal basis for the ruling, and that, as a result, it was not legally binding on Google. But he added, "The company has the right to decide whether or not it should sell this product." Google has long been criticized for its lack of transparency in its search results. It has also faced criticism from critics who say it is a product that is designed to mislead consumers. In particular, some critics have accused Google of not being transparent enough about what it does and how it operates. Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson - type- footer | Comment: On the other hand, there have been a number of cases in which Google did not comply with German laws and regulations. One of them was the case of a German citizen who was arrested and charged with copyright infringement. Another case involved a citizen of Germany, Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, who worked at Google for more than a decade. This case was brought by the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and is currently being investigated by German law enforcement authorities. Google is also facing a similar case in France, where a judge ruled on the same issue last year, saying it would be "unacceptable" if Google sold its product without the consent of German citizens. That case, however, has not yet been heard by Berlin's court of appeals, according to a report by a leading German newspaper, The Berlin-based online news site, Der Spiegel, citing unnamed court sources. On Tuesday, German prosecutors said they would appeal the verdict in a case that could lead to further legal action. They also said that they had not been able to obtain the necessary documents to make a decision on how to proceed in this case. Further, they said Google could not be held responsible for any of these cases because they were "too big to have any effect on German society at all." They added that if they did, then Google would have to pay a fine of up to €1,000 per month for each violation of copyright law. And they also argued that this would not result in any kind of tax or tax relief for Germans who bought their products from Google or other companies. So far, no one has come forward with any evidence of any wrongdoing. Nevertheless, Germany has a reputation for being an open and transparent country, even if it means that some of its citizens do not want to purchase the products. For this reason, many people are skeptical about the idea of selling them to foreigners. Many people believe that such a move would only harm the image of their country and the people who use them. Yet, this is the first time the government has made such an attempt to regulate the market. What's more, most people don't understand the concept of "street view" and why it has become so controversial. Why is it so important to Google? Because it's not clear whether Google can be trusted to carry out its business as usual, or whether it will continue to operate as an independent company. "
,"Reference text": " Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. "Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences," Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. "We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along." A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a "landmark decision," saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. "Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights," wrote Thomas Hören, a professor of media and communications law at the University of Münster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. "The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera)," he added. "And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts."

},{"Generated text": " Banking watchdog calls for Libor to be scrapped Britain's benchmark interest rate is set to expire at the end of the year, the country's parliamentary commission on banking standards said Wednesday. The move comes after a series of scandals rocked the banking industry. In a report released on Wednesday, a parliamentary panel of lawmakers said that the Bank of England should be stripped of its role in setting the benchmark rate, which was set by the British government in 2008. "We have to make sure that we don't overstep our obligations," said lawmaker Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the committee, adding that it would be "very difficult" for the bank to comply with the new rules. It would also be the first time that a British bank has been stripped from its post as a member of parliament since the 2008 financial crisis, when it was the world's largest lender by market value. A number of banks in the UK have been accused of cheating the market, including Royal Bank and HSBC, over the past few years. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters) - type-in0-x - British Official Opposition The committee said it had been unable to reach a consensus on the issue, but the government had made it clear that there was a "strong consensus" among lawmakers that banks should not be allowed to continue to charge interest rates based on their own personal wealth. Members of Parliament said they were "deeply concerned" about the prospect of such a move, saying that they had "no confidence" in a government that would take action to protect the financial system from being manipulated by unscrupulous financial institutions. They said the move would have a negative impact on banks' ability to compete with other banks, and that "it will be difficult for banks to keep up with a rising rate of interest on deposits." The commission also called for an end to the practice of charging banks more for their deposits, as well as to allow them to hold more deposits at their banks without the risk of losing their balance sheets. Banks have also been under pressure from regulators to reduce the amount of money they lend to each other, according to a statement from the company's chief executive, George Osborne, in which he said he was "extremely disappointed" by what he described as an "unprecedented" rise in borrowing costs. However, he added, "there is no reason why banks shouldn't be able to do what they are doing right now," in light of recent scandals involving high-frequency trading and the use of fake credit cards and other financial instruments. He also pointed out that some banks were already paying more than they should in order to attract customers, while others were charging higher rates to lure them away from their customers.   This is a major blow to banks because it has caused a lot of confusion among the public about how much money is being held in their accounts and how many people are actually using the accounts to pay their bills. Some lawmakers have accused the banks of overcharging, with one lawmaker accusing them of understating the total amount they owe to customers and others of not doing enough to ensure that customers get their money back. One lawmaker said: "This is not the case at all. I think it's a very serious issue and it is something that is going to have serious consequences for our banking system. We need to take a look at what we have done in recent years and see if we can do something about it," he told parliamentarians in an interview with AFP news agency. Another lawmaker added that he would like to see more transparency in how banks are being treated in relation to their lending practices, such as lending to individuals and companies, rather than the way they use credit card companies. Other lawmakers also expressed concern that this could lead to an increase in lending rates, although they did not specify what kind of lending rate they would expect to receive in return for doing business with banks that do not lend money to them. This could be a problem for many banks as the rate rises in Britain are still too high, they said, citing the high cost of borrowing to finance their operations and high costs of servicing their debts.

,"Reference text": " UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been "shocking and widespread," said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? "Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered," the 500-page report said. "Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail." The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to "reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards." The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters) "

Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to announce the resignation of her finance minister on Thursday. The chancellor's spokesman, Klaus Zimmermann, told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper that she would be stepping down from her post at the end of the month. "The chancellor will be replaced by Rainer Bruederle," the spokesman said in a statement. He added that the chancellor would not be able to make a decision on the future of Germany's foreign policy until after the election. According to the German Institute for Economic Research, the deputy chancellor of Economics and Economics, Rainers Bruerle, who is also the minister of foreign affairs, will take up the post until the new chancellor is sworn in on July 1. In his first speech since taking office in 2011, Chancellor Merkel said she was "deeply concerned" about the state of affairs in Germany, which she described as a "strange situation." "I am deeply concerned," she said, adding that it was not the first time she had been asked to resign. Her spokesman Steffen Seibert said: "It is a very serious situation, and it is not something that is going to be tolerated by the government." The FDP, however, has said it will continue to work with the finance ministry to find a way to improve the situation. It is unclear how long the ministry will stay in its current position, but it has been clear for some time that there is no longer a need for it. On the other hand, there are a number of things that have changed in recent years. For instance, in 1992, when the economy was still very much in recession, unemployment was very low and wages were very high. Now, it seems as though the unemployment rate has fallen to a new low, with unemployment at a four-year low of 6.5 percent. This is the second time in less than a year that a chancellor has taken over the foreign ministry. Author: Matt Zuvela (Reuters/dapd/derpa) Editor: Sean Sinico - type of footer The government has also been accused of not doing enough to protect the interests of its own citizens. However, a spokesman for the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) said on Wednesday that "the government is doing everything it can to ensure that its citizens do not have to suffer the consequences of their actions," referring to Merkel's decision to leave the cabinet in favor of a free-market liberal government. But the CDU spokesman also said the party had no plans to change its stance on free trade, saying it had "no intention of changing its position on this issue." In an interview with Handelsblat newspaper, he said that his party would continue with its opposition to any kind of free market government, even if it were to do so under the guise of protecting the rights of citizens who are not citizens of other countries, such as the United States or the EU, as long as it does not interfere with international trade and the rule of law in their own countries. His comments come as part of an effort to reassure the public that Germany is on a path to becoming a more open and free society, despite the fact that many people are opposed to free markets, including the right-wing populists, say they want to see the country become more free and open to all kinds of products and services from all sorts of countries and industries. That is, if the Chancellor is willing to give up her position as chancellor, she will have no choice but to accept the position she has in her own country, according to sources close to her. And that's not just because she's a conservative politician. She's also a strong supporter of freedom of speech and democracy, says the head of state for education, education and social welfare, Helmut Kohl, an economist who has worked in government for more than 30 years and is now a member of parliament for a third time since the 1990s. There are also other factors that could influence her decision-making process. One of them is her refusal to sign up for an EU membership, for example, to join the European Union. Another factor is that her party has not yet decided whether or not it wants to participate in EU member states' negotiations with other EU states. A third factor, though, could be the lack of cooperation between the two parties. Both parties have a long history of opposing each other's policies on economic issues. "
,"Reference text": " Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. "When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it," Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. "That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter," said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. "I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous," Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. "We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year," Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

The move comes as the country prepares to host a referendum on whether to accept a pro-Western constitution. Belarus is set to hold an election on Friday. A new president will be sworn in at the end of the month, Belarus's foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said Friday, adding that he would not seek re-election. "I will not accept the results of this election," he told a news conference in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, ahead of a parliamentary vote scheduled for later in the day. Poland, Poland and Belarus are also expected to vote on the new constitution, which is due to take effect on Thursday. Author: Darren Mara (Reuters, AFP) Editor: Nancy Isenson In a statement issued by the foreign ministry, German Foreign Minister Guida Westerweel said that Belarus would accept an independent constitution if it wanted to. He added that the constitution would allow the president to run for a second term in office. However, he did not rule out the possibility of an extension of his term, saying that it would be up to the parliament to decide whether or not to recognize the constitutional constitution as a constitutional amendment. Germany, however, said it was not ready to give up its veto over the referendum. It said the vote would take place within the framework of parliamentary elections set up in 1994, when Belarus became the first country to join the European Union after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1986. In response, Germany and Poland said they would hold a special election in Belarus next year, with the aim of electing a president who would have the right to veto any constitutional amendments passed by parliament. Ukraine has long been a staunch ally of Russia, and has been one of Moscow's most reliable allies since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Russian President Mikhail Myasnikovich, a former KGB agent, is also a strong supporter of Ukraine's independence from Moscow, although he has not ruled out a return to a post-Soviet state. Russia has repeatedly accused the West of meddling in its internal affairs, accusing the United States and other Western powers of trying to undermine its rule of law in a bid to protect its citizens from the spread of Russian influence in their home country. On Thursday, Russia accused Belarus of using chemical weapons against its own citizens, prompting a diplomatic row between the two countries over who should be allowed to stay in power in return for an unconditional end to Russian support for the former Soviet republics. Moscow has denied the accusations, but the Kremlin has insisted that any such accusations are "baseless" and that Moscow is not seeking to interfere with its domestic affairs in order to maintain its influence over its foreign policy. According to an official statement, Moscow denies the allegations and says it has "no intention" of interfering in any future elections, despite repeated attempts by Western governments to prevent such a move. Experts say the Russian government has a long history of backing down from its stance on human rights violations, particularly in relation to nuclear weapons. They also say that Russia does not have a monopoly on nuclear power, as long as it doesn't use it for weapons of mass destruction, such as atomic weapons, or for nuclear energy. But they say it is a matter of time before a decision is made on how to deal with such an issue, given the current political situation in Ukraine and the fact that there is no clear consensus on what to do about the situation there, according to experts and diplomats in both countries who have spoken to Reuters and AFP news agency in recent days. Some analysts believe that a deal could be reached before the election, while others believe it could not be done at all, because the elections are still being held in secret and there are no guarantees of any kind of agreement between Belarus and Russia. This is the second time in less than a year Belarus has faced a political crisis in which its president has refused to sign an agreement with Moscow on a number of key issues, including whether it wants to keep its nuclear program alive and how long it will take to implement the nuclear deal or whether Moscow will allow it to continue to use nuclear technology on its missiles.

,"Reference text": " Belarusian president accuses Germany, Poland of coup plans Before being sworn in for a fourth term, the reclusive leader of Belarus fired a warning salvo at the European Union, accusing Germany and Poland of plotting a coup and threatening action against sanctions. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. "There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order," Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. "This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies." Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were "baseless" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. "The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters," Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the "hardest possible reaction" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

India's interior ministry said on Monday that it was working closely with Myanmar authorities to ensure that the Rohingya do not return to their homes in the country. "We are working with the government of India to make sure that Myanmar does not allow the return of its citizens," said Colin Gonsalves, a spokesman for the India-Bangladesh border ministry. The Indian government has said it will continue to monitor the situation in Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh and is part of the Myanmar-India border. However, India has yet to decide whether to impose a blanket ban on the influx of refugees from Myanmar, the United Nations said in a statement Monday. Indian officials have said that they have not yet made a decision on whether or not to enforce the ban, but they are hopeful that a final decision will be reached by the end of this week. In an apparent attempt to avoid a confrontation, Indian Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was "very concerned" about Myanmar's decision to allow Rohingya refugees into India. He also said India would continue its efforts to provide legal assistance to Rohingya, who have been living in India for more than a year. Lawyer Thaung Tun, an Indian citizen of Bangladeshi origin, told DW that India had asked Myanmar to stop allowing Rohingya to enter its border with Bangladesh. According to him, Myanmar has refused to do so, saying it would only allow them to cross into its territory if they wanted to. Bangladesh has also expressed concern about the possibility of allowing the refugees to stay in its borders, he said, adding that there was a "clear and present danger" of a possible conflict between the two countries. A UN report released on August 25, however, did not mention Myanmar as the main reason for allowing them in. It said Myanmar had been trying to prevent the exodus of thousands of Muslims from the predominantly Muslim state of Jammu and Kashmir since August, when the army took over the state's security forces in response to an attack by Rohingya militants in August. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have criticized the move, calling it "unprecedented" and "a clear violation of international humanitarian law." The UN's human rights office in New Delhi, meanwhile, accused India of not doing enough to protect Rohingya from persecution, and said the Indian authorities had failed to act on its request. On August 3, Bangladesh's parliament passed a resolution calling for a general assembly to be held on October 3 to discuss the issue. But the UN and the International Criminal Court (ICC) said they were not ready to hold such a meeting until the resolution was reached. UN experts have also warned that if India does decide to go ahead with its plan, it could face legal action against Myanmar if it does so at the earliest. DW's Prashant Bhushan spoke to a lawyer from India who has been working for several years with India and was involved in several cases involving Rohingya in recent years. His client is an Indo-Aryan who lives in Pakistan, where he is married and has two children. Last year, his client moved to India from Bangladesh to seek asylum in Delhi after a court ruled that he could not be granted asylum there due to his religious beliefs. Since then, many of his clients have fled to neighboring countries, such as Pakistan and India, according to legal experts. One of them is a Hindu-Muslim married woman. She has a son and a daughter who is also a Muslim. Her husband and two daughters are also Hindus, she said. They have two sons and three daughters. Their father and daughter are Hindus and she has three grandchildren. As a result, her husband has become a prominent figure in Indian politics, as well as in international media. Both men are Hindu and have a close relationship with her mother and father-in-law. When the Supreme Court issued its verdict, both men were arrested and charged with crimes against humanity. At the time of their arrest, there were no charges of any crimes committed against them. There was also no mention of an FIR filed against the men by India against their religion. "

The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were "illegal" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as "ethnic cleansing." Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. "We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss," Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a "serious threat to national security." The government also said there was a "serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya." Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. "We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no," he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. "The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows," Gonsalves told DW. "And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide." In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found "little evidence of the government claim." The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. "It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims," said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. "I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation," he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. "India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

The American cyclist is set to take part in the cycling world's biggest sporting event on Monday. Armstrong, who has been banned from cycling for three years, will compete for the first time in October. "I'm very happy to be here," Armstrong said in a statement released by the International Cycling Union (IUCN). "It's been a long time coming, and I'm really looking forward to getting back out there and competing again," he said, adding that he was "very happy" with the results. He added that the Tour would be a "big step forward" in his quest to improve his chances of becoming a world champion in cycling, which he has dominated since the start of his career in 1999. In the past, Armstrong had been barred from competing in major sporting events due to his involvement in doping. But now, he is hoping to get back into the sport and compete in some of the most prestigious events on the planet, including the Vuelta a España, the Grand Tour and the World Championships in Paris-Roubaix, where he will be competing as a soloist. US Anti-Doping Agency chief Pat McQuaid said the agency would continue to monitor Armstrong's performance, but he did not rule out the possibility of a return to cycling. jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP) - "We're going to see what happens with Lance and his team. We'll see if we can get him back on track. I don't think he'll be able to compete again until he's fully recovered from his doping suspension." - A spokesman for Armstrong told the Associated Press news agency that Armstrong was not aware of any doping allegations against him. However, "he is aware that there are a number of people who have tested positive for doping," the spokesman said. - Anheuser-Busch-owned beer maker Rabobank has also been accused of using banned substances in its beer, beer and tobacco products, as well as in an attempt to boost its sales in Texas and New Mexico, according to a report from the journal "The American Journal of Public Health." The company said it would not comment on specific cases of doping, although it did say that it had not received a formal complaint from Armstrong about his use of banned drugs in previous Tour events, such as last year's WorldTour, in which the cyclist was disqualified for using a banned substance and was fined $1,000 for failing to provide a urine sample. That's the second time this year that an athlete has failed to pass a drug test, after Armstrong failed a similar test at the 2014 Tour event in New York City in July. According to the report, a total of 12 people have been arrested in connection with Armstrong’s doping case. Some of those arrested have pleaded guilty to drug possession, while others have not been charged with a crime. Others have denied any wrongdoing, saying they were merely trying to help Armstrong get a clean bill of health and that they had no idea what was going on in their system. They have also accused Armstrong of lying to police and saying he didn't know anything about the alleged doping scheme. While the case against Armstrong is still under investigation, it is not clear whether the former cyclist has a criminal record or whether he had any links to any drug-related offenses, or if he simply lied about it to cover up his tracks. If he does, then he could face charges of violating the rules of sportsmanship and drug use laws in order to gain access to drugs and alcohol. As a result, his name will no longer be listed on a list of prohibited substances that can be used as part of an anti-doping program. It is unclear how long Armstrong will remain banned, however, if the ban will last and if it will not be lifted by a court ruling in September or October, when he hopes to regain his status as cycling's most popular sportswriter. A new law will also be put in place to make it easier for athletes to obtain clean drinking water and other forms of medical treatment. "

"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling," said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. "UCI is listening and is on your side. We’ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again." The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the "most sophisticated" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date.

Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch.

"It is important that we have the right of choice," Romney added, referring to his father's death in 1986, when the Italian dictator Ronald Reagan was still alive. Romney, however, did not respond to questions from reporters about whether he would support the Republican nominee for president in November. Neither did Abbott, a Republican from Texas who has long been a staunch supporter of abortion rights, nor Romney. Both men have said they would vote for Obama if he won re-election. dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa) - type-in0-x, as in previous years, but in June, he called for a referendum on whether to allow abortion to be allowed in US states. If the referendum is approved, it would be the first time that a US president has been confirmed by a state legislature in more than 40 years. It would also be his second term in office, and his first since he took office in 2006. His term as Senate majority leader ended last June after two years as minority leader, with a majority of Republicans opposed to abortion in states where abortion is legal. After the November election, Republican leaders in both houses of Congress voted in favor of a repeal of Obamacare, which would have made it easier for abortion legal in some states to take place in other states, including Texas and New Mexico. However, Republicans in Congress have long opposed the repeal, arguing that repealing the law would make it more difficult for people to obtain abortions in those states without a doctor's license. They also oppose the legalization of gay marriage in many states and say it could lead to an increase in deaths among young people in rural areas.

But the bill has faced opposition from conservative groups and some Republicans who say the move is an attempt to undermine the ACA's protections for gays and lesbians. As a result, many conservatives are calling for an end to Obama's signature on a healthcare reform bill. Many conservatives believe the legislation should be extended to include gay rights as well as transgender rights. Some have called it an "amnesty" bill, while others call it "anti-choice" legislation. Others argue that Obama should sign it into law, saying it violates the constitution and should not be used as a tool for discrimination against gays or lesbians or transgender people. "

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended "their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family," White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a "man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law." "He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans," Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. "The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice," Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. "Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president," McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor "in due time." "These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party," he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would "hide my head in a bag" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was "couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic." dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa) " 

},{"Generated text": " German Studies in Mexico City Tonatiuh Ibarra is studying German Studies at the Goethe Institute in Freiburg. The German studies professor is interested in studying the history of the German language in the Mexican city of Mexico. "I am fascinated by the idea of German as a foreign language," he says. He has been studying in Germany for the past two years, and he is currently working on a dissertation on the subject. In Mexico, he hopes to become a professor at a German-language university. His dissertation will be published next year in German, in which he plans to study German and Mexican studies. It is expected that he will become an expert on German history and German culture, as well as on how to translate German into other foreign languages. But he also hopes that his research will lead to a better understanding of how German is used in other countries, such as the United States, the European Union and the Middle East. Mexico is a very different country from Germany, but it has a lot in common with Germany. I have always wanted to learn German from my native country of Baden-Württemberg, where I was born and raised. And I want to be able to do that in my own country. So I'm going to try to get a PhD in this subject, which is very important for me because it will help me understand German better and how it can be applied to other areas of my life.   I am currently enrolled in an exchange program with a university in Berlin that focuses on Germany's history, culture and language. This program is part of a project to develop a new language curriculum for German students, to help them understand the language and culture of Germany in their own countries. We will also be doing a study on Mexican culture in order to better understand what it is like to live in a country where there are so many different cultures, languages, cultures and traditions. For me, this is the most important aspect of learning German: it gives me a sense of freedom and freedom of expression. That freedom is what makes me so happy, I think, because I feel like I can learn something new every day, even if it's just for a short period of time. There is also the freedom to experiment with different forms of education, so I don't have to worry about what the future holds for my education. My main concern is that I will not be exposed to the same kind of foreign culture as I did when I came to Germany - that is to say, that there is no freedom for foreigners to come here and learn about German in our country - and that this freedom will only be available to those who are willing to give it to us in exchange for an education that they can use as an instrument of their choice. If that's the case, then I would be happy to contribute to that freedom in any other country, whether it be Germany or Mexico - or in some other way, for example, if I choose to travel to another country and study in another language, or even to teach German at another university - which I do not have the opportunity to go to right now. All of these things are important to me and I hope that my studies will show that Germany is becoming more and more like Mexico in many ways than it was before I arrived here. What do you think about this? What are your thoughts on this topic? Do you agree with me that it should be a topic of discussion with the Federal State? Is it a question of whether or not the federal government should do something about it? The answer is yes, of course, yes and no. However, it does not necessarily mean that the government will do anything to prevent this from happening. As a matter of fact, we have already discussed this issue with our government and we will continue to discuss it with them in due course. Let's see if we can find a solution to this problem. Is there a way to make it easier for us to have a discussion about the issue of immigration? Yes, there will definitely be an answer to these questions. "

},{"Generated text": " Pope Francis praises Russian Orthodox Church in Mexico Pope Francis has praised Russia's Roman Catholic Church for its efforts to combat terrorism in the country. But the pontiff has also criticized Russia for failing to act in a timely manner. In a letter to Russian Patriarch Kirill, Francis called on Russia to step up its fight against terrorism. "Russia is the only country that is willing to stand up for the rule of law," Francis wrote. The letter, which was sent to the Patriarch of Mexico, was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of Cuba's Legion of Christ, and the Russian patriarch, Patriarch Marcial Maciel, who has been in jail since September 2014. It was the first letter from the pope to Russia since the end of the Cold War, in which Russia was accused of harboring terrorists. Francis also called for a "total and complete end to all forms of terrorism," according to a translation by DW's Astrid Prange. He also said that Russia should not be allowed to impose its will on other countries, such as Cuba, Cuba and Cuba. And he urged the Vatican to take a closer look at the situation in Latin America, saying that it was "a very difficult situation to deal with." The pope's letter also calls for Mexico to cooperate with the US in its investigation into the deaths of thousands of Christians and refugees in recent years. Mexico's Catholic bishops, led by Pope Benedict XVI, have also been critical of Russia. They have been criticized for not doing enough to protect the rights of persecuted Christians, particularly those who have suffered persecution in their home country of Iguala and Monterrey, as well as for their treatment of migrants and asylum seekers. This has led to tensions between the two countries. On the one hand, Russia has a long history of supporting the Catholic church, but on the other, it's a very different story. At the same time, there is a strong sense of solidarity between Russia and Mexico. Both countries have strong ties to their respective Orthodox communities, with Russia being one of them. However, this is not the case with Mexico: The Vatican has not been able to reach a consensus on whether or not to allow the expulsion of Russian clergy and their families from its territory. That's because Russia is also not a country with a large Catholic population. There is no consensus in Rome on how to handle the issue of immigration. For the most part, however, that's not what the Pope has said. Instead, he's been very clear about what he wants to do: He doesn't want to see a repeat of what happened in his own country in 2014, when he was in prison in Ciudad Juarez, a city that has seen a number of violent attacks on Christians since then. His message is clear: "We are not going to tolerate this kind of behavior in our country," he said, adding that he would not tolerate it in any other country, even if it were to be tolerated. 'We will not allow it to happen again' In the face of all the accusations against Russia, President Putin has already made it clear that his country is in no position to accept a return to its former Soviet-style rule. As a result, his message has become more and more controversial. Even though he has expressed his desire to reform the way Russia treats its citizens, many of his critics have criticized him for being too lenient with his stance on human rights. Some have even accused him of being anti-gay, while others have said he should be more open-minded and open to dialogue. Still others say that Francis' letter is an attempt to make Mexico a better place to live and a place where people can live in peace and harmony with one another, rather than just another country where they are persecuted by their own government. So far, so good. I'm not sure that this will ever happen, because I don't think it will happen any time soon. What I do know is that there are a lot of people who would like to have the chance to come to Mexico and be a part of this new world order. We will see what happens when we have a new pope who is ready to lead the world. "
,"Reference text": " Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Peña Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours. " 

},{"Generated text": " Amnesty International calls for end to torture in Europe The Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) has called on the European Council of Europe (ECE) to end the practice of torturing people in their home countries. Amnesty International's Carla Ferstman is calling for a halt to the torture of people living in European countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Ukraine and Ukraine. "This is a very serious issue," she told DW in an interview on Wednesday, adding that the Council was "deeply concerned" by the findings of the Committee's 24th General Report, which was published in the journal "Human Rights and International Law." The report is part of a larger effort to reduce the number of torture cases in Eastern Europe. The committee has been working for several years to address the issue, and in recent years it has become increasingly clear that there is no end in sight. In the past few years, there have been a lot of cases where torture has taken place, but now it seems that it is finally coming to an end. It is now time for Europe to take action against the perpetrators of these crimes, particularly those who have committed crimes against humanity or who are suspected of carrying out acts of terrorism, such as murder, rape, torture, or other forms of human rights violations. There is also a growing concern that Europe is becoming more and more vulnerable to these kinds of crimes. At the same time, the EU is beginning to see the effects of its own policies on its citizens. For example, in Ukraine, where the regime of President Viktor Yanukovich is based, it's becoming increasingly difficult for people to leave their homes and to return to their families. This has led to a rise in attacks on EU citizens, especially young people, as well as the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment in many parts of eastern Europe and the Middle East. As a result, many people have fled to other countries to escape the violence and persecution of their own people. However, this has not been the case in other Eastern European nations. On the other hand, some Eastern Europeans have come to rely on European law to protect them from the horrors of war and oppression. These are the countries that have suffered the most under the rule of law since the end of World War II, with the exception of Poland and Hungary. They have also been forced to flee to neighboring countries in order to avoid facing the consequences of such attacks. And in some cases, they have even resorted to resorting to violence against their neighbors. But this is not the first time Europe has faced this kind of situation. During the Cold War, US President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister David Cameron were both accused of using torture as a weapon of mass destruction. Now, President Obama is trying to change that. He wants to make Europe a more humane place to live and a place where people can live without fear of reprisals. So far, however, he has failed to do so. Instead, his administration has made it a priority to ensure that European governments do not resort to harsh measures against people who commit crimes like torture and murder. That is why the US has launched a new round of sanctions against Russia, Iran, Syria, North Korea and other hostile actors. US Secretary of State John Kerry has also called for European leaders to be held accountable for their actions, saying that they should not be allowed to act without the consent of EU leaders. Kerry also said that he would be willing to step down from his post as US president if the sanctions were lifted. What is the point of all this? "I think we should be able to move on," Kerry said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in Washington, D.C., in which he said he wanted to "move on from this current situation." "We have to look at what is happening in our own countries and how we can move forward," he added, referring to Europe's relations with Russia and China. Is there a way out of this situation? The US and EU have already begun to talk about the possibility of ending the use of force against European citizens who live in countries with high crime rates and high unemployment. Do you think this will be a problem for EU countries? I don't think so at all. I think it will take a long time before we get to that point. If we do, then we will have a difficult time getting Europe back on track. "
,"Reference text": " Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. "Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture," CPT President Letif Hüseynov said in a statement. "I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions." The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. "The first thing to say is how important the CPT is," said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. "As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT." But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. "In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented," said Ferstman. "It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated." But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. "The dialogue that they are able to have is really important," she said. "Looking long-term, they have been very effective." CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. "What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived," said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. "It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well." The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. "With Greece there are two things to remember," Dempsey told DW. "A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years." "Immigration detention is a growing issue," added Ferstman. "In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture." "

The event commemorates the end of World War II in the German city. It also marks the beginning of a new era for East German politics. On Friday, Dresden's mayor Helma Orosz, who was born in 1945 in East Germany, will be remembered as a hero for his courage and courage in fighting against the Nazi regime. She will also receive a medal from the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of Germany (PEGIDA) organization, which she founded in 2005. DW's Naomi Conrad and Yadegar Asisi are among those who will attend the service. "It is a great honor to be a part of this memorial," she told DW, adding that she was "very proud to have been a member of that organization for many years." "I am very proud of what I have done. I am a proud German woman, and I will continue to fight for my country and my people." The memorial ceremony was held at the Frauenkirche, the city's cultural center, on Friday evening. There were also a number of other memorials in attendance, including a statue of German artist Siegfriede Leonhard and a monument to the martyrs who fought for Germany during the war. Many of them were dedicated to their country's liberation from Nazi rule. They are also remembered for their bravery and their courage to stand up for what they believed in. In their memory, they are remembered by many as heroes of war and for fighting for our freedom. Their memory lives on in their hearts and minds, as are the memories of their battles with the Nazis. But the memory of those battles is still fresh in our minds. We are still living in a time when we have to live in fear of losing our homeland. That is why we are here today. And that is what we want to do, because it is our duty to protect the homeland and to defend the freedom of our people. This is something that we must do together, even if it means sacrificing our country, our culture and our values. As a result, we will not be able to go back to those days when Germany was the only country in Europe that was willing to give up its Nazi past and embrace the new world order. So, what do we do now? We will do something about it. What do you think we should do? What are you going to say? Do you have any ideas for how to make Dresden a better city? I don't know, but I think it's a good place to start. Let's see if we can find a solution to this problem. How can we get to a place like Dresden where there are so many people who have lost their homes and who are trying to leave the country? That's the question that I would like to ask myself. Is there a way for us to move on from Dresden? Is it possible that Dresden will become a city that has lost its sense of identity and identity? The question is, how will we find that identity again? In October, German President Joachim Gauck announced that he would be stepping down from his post as president in order to focus on "the future of Europe." In a speech at a rally in Canterbury, Canterbury's cathedral, he said he hoped to see a change in Germany's image of itself. He also said that his country would "not be the same as the United States" as it was before the fall of Nazi Germany in October. However, in his speech he also called on the West to respect the rights of minorities, especially young people, particularly women and minorities. His speech was a reminder of how important it can be to preserve the values of democracy and human rights in an era when the world is divided into two camps: Germany and Europe. Germany is the first country to recognize the role of Islam in its history. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a referendum on whether or not Germany should join the European Union. A referendum is scheduled to take place in November. If the referendum goes ahead, Germany will have the option of joining the EU. "
,"Reference text": " Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: "You know, my mother never told me about the bombings." She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. "It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it," the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. "There was nothing left, nothing," a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, "just rubble and death." He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: "It's so hard being here." The soundtrack and images, he said, "bring back too many memories." 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. "But we were lucky: We survived," he said. "There were so, so many dead." His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, "the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims," Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace "War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds," Orosz said. "We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color," she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: “We don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.” Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the “miracle that peace in Europe represents,” leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. "I can remember it all," Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden "for at least 60 years." Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. " "

But he added that it was not an act of terrorism, and that there was no reason to believe that a terrorist attack would result in a civilian loss of life. In fact, he said, the attacks were a result of a lack of coordination between Afghan security forces and Taliban fighters. It was the first time that an Afghan restaurant had been targeted by an insurgent attack since the fall of President Hamid Karzai in April 2012. Afghan Analysts Network (AfN) correspondent Thomas Ruttig, who is based in London, said that despite the fact that Taliban attacks have been taking place in recent months, there is no evidence that any of these attacks are being carried out in retaliation for a NATO attack. There is, however, speculation that this may be the case, given the recent spate of attacks on Afghan government buildings and police forces. However, it is not yet clear whether or not this is a new trend, or whether it will continue to be so. According to a recent report from Afghanistan's Konrad Adenauer Institute, Taliban insurgents have attacked several Afghan cities and towns, including Qargha Lake in Parwan Province, where the capital, Kabul, is located. This is the second time in as many years that Afghan forces have targeted a foreign-owned restaurant. Last year, Afghan officials accused NATO of arming and training Taliban militants in their bid to overthrow the country's government. They also accused the NATO-led coalition of supporting the insurgents. Afghanistan has a long history of violence against civilians, particularly in rural areas, such as the northern province of Kandahar. During the 2012-13 Afghan war, thousands of civilians were killed and thousands more were injured. At the end of 2012, around 1,000 people died in clashes between Taliban and government forces, according to Afghan analysts. Some of those killed were Afghan soldiers, while others were civilians. On Friday, one Afghan journalist, Hussein Sirat, described the situation as "very tense." "It's a very tense situation," said the correspondent, referring to an incident that took place last month in which Taliban gunmen shot dead a man in front of his house, killing him and wounding several others. Another Afghan soldier was also killed, but he was later released from a hospital after being treated for his wounds. Despite this, many Afghans are still optimistic about the future of their country and are optimistic that Afghanistan will emerge from the conflict unscathed. Many of them are hopeful that Kabul will be able to return to its former self-styled "Islamic State" (IS) rule in 2014. Others are skeptical, though, because they believe the government is still in control of many areas of Afghanistan, as well as a large number of villages and villages. For the past few years, they've been fighting for their own survival. Now, after years of war and a decade of political stalemate, Afghans have finally come to terms with the reality that they no longer have the security they used to have. That's why they're still fighting each other. And they don't want to give up on their fight against the IS. So, in order to avoid a repeat of what happened in 2012 and 2013, we have to take a look at what has happened since then. What is happening now? What are the next steps for Afghanistan? "We're going to try to find out what is going on. We'll see what we can do about it," the journalist said. How long will it take to get the word out? In the coming days, Afghanistan is expected to see a significant increase in Taliban activity, with more attacks expected. "
,"Reference text": " Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet "as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy," said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, "at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years," Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. "You have to carefully monitor the security situation," Nils Wörmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. "But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy." Wörmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. "It was immediately clear to me that something had happened," Wörmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. "We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious," Wörmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. "The security precautions are high," Wörmer said. "But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again." But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. "Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal," said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. "The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed," he said. "But the people won't bend to this intimidation." How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But Wörmer is not thinking about giving up. "We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible," Wörmer said. "I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks." " 

},{"Generated text": " South Africa's water crisis highlights the challenges facing the country Marelize Botes, a water expert at the University of Stellenbosch in Johannesburg, has spoken out against the current crisis in the South African water sector. "The situation in South Africa is dire," she told Deutsche Welle in an interview. The crisis has been exacerbated by a lack of awareness about the need to tackle the problem of water shortages in Africa. According to a report by the Water Institute, more than 1,000 people have been forced to leave their homes due to the shortage of drinking water in their home countries. This has led to fears that the crisis could spread to other African countries as well. In the past few years, the number of people who have left the water industry has increased by about 40 percent, according to data from the US-based water consultancy firm Maplecroft. But the situation has not improved, and the government has yet to make a decision on how to address the issue. At the same time, there is a growing awareness among the public of the dire need for better water management, particularly in developing countries such as Somalia, Sudan, Mauritania and Sudan. There is also growing concern over the impact of climate change on water quality in these countries, especially in countries with high levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Climate change is one of these problems, but it is not the first time that this has happened. For example, in Somalia there was a massive increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2011, which caused the death of over 2,500 people. Since then, it has become more and more common for people to seek refuge in other countries in search of clean water. It has also been the case in Sudan where there were reports of a rise in methane levels. However, this is only the latest development in a series of cases where the level of methane released into the atmosphere has risen. Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper The problem is that there are no reliable sources of data on the extent to which water is being used for drinking purposes. So far, however, no one has come forward to say that they are aware of this problem. What is important to note is the fact that many people are not aware that water can be used to clean up the environment. That is because it's not possible to know for sure how long it will take for water to reach the surface and how much water will be stored in it. Therefore, we have to wait for the authorities to come up with a solution. If they don't do that, then we will not be able to do anything about it at all. We will continue to work with them until we know what is going to happen," said Eugen Cloete, an expert in water and sanitation. He added that it would be a mistake to assume that all the information that is available on this website is from a government source, rather than a private company. And that's exactly what we are looking for, he said, because we do not have a reliable source of information on what's going on in our water supply. To be sure, I have no idea what the solution is. I am not a scientist, nor am I a researcher, so I can't say for certain what I think is happening in my own country. My main focus is on improving the quality of life for all of our people and making sure that we all have access to safe and reliable water sources, including our homes and our schools and hospitals. As a result, my research has shown that in many cases, water supplies are getting worse and worse as we get older. When it comes to water, you will find that you are more likely to die than you were to live in your home. You will also find it more difficult to get a job because you have more money to spend on your education than if you had to go to school." "Water is an important part of your life," says Bote, adding that she and her colleagues are working on a plan to improve water security in her home country of South-Africa. She says the plan is "very ambitious" and "not only for our country but also for Africa." She believes that if the system is to be fully implemented, people will have the opportunity to find out for themselves whether or not they want to continue living in poverty or if they have enough money.

,"Reference text": " Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. "The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market," she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies "This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives," said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. "It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream," Cloete said. "So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle." The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. "We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale," he said. "The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application." Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper "

The first thing you need to know is that you are in a bad situation. You are not going to make it out of the worst situation in your life. That is, if you can get to the bottom of it, then you will not be able to do anything about it. It is not your fault that the problem is so bad, but it is your responsibility. And that is what I am trying to tell you. This is the first time I have had to deal with a situation like this in my life, where I can't even remember what it was like when I was in high school, and I couldn't remember the last time that I had a problem. I don't know how I managed to get through it all. But I did manage to find a solution that worked for me, which was to take care of my own personal problems. So, I took a look at my situation and decided that this was the best solution I could come up with. What do I do now? I try to figure out what my problems are and how to fix them so that they can be fixed. Then I go to my computer and see if there are any problems that need fixing. There are a lot of problems with the computer, so I decided to try and solve them. One of them was that there was a computer problem that was causing me to have a hard time getting to sleep at night. When I woke up the next morning, my eyes were wide open and my head was throbbing from the pain of having to wake up at 6:30 a.m. (ET) I went to bed at 7:15 am and fell asleep at 8:45 am. At 9:59 am I awoke at 5:00 am, with my alarm clock still on, to see what was going on. In the morning I got up and went downstairs to check on my kids. They were all asleep by 7am. After a few hours of sleep, the alarm went off and they were both awake by 10:10. A few minutes later I came downstairs and saw that my daughter had fallen asleep on the couch. She was up to her eyeballs in her sleep and she was still asleep. My wife woke me up in bed and told me that she had been up all night and that her husband had called her and asked her to come over and help him. We both agreed that we would do everything in our power to help her but she said no, because we had no idea what we were doing was wrong and we needed help.So, we did everything we could do, except for one thing: we got help from our computers and our phones. Everything was fine, right? That was it! We got everything done! And now we just got to work on it and now it's all done. Now we're just waiting for the day to go home and get ready for bed. All of a sudden we have one more thing to worry about: the internet is dead! Everything is back to normal again! The internet has been down for a long time now and the Internet is down! I think we all know this is a big problem because everything has gone down, everything is up, all of this stuff is out, even the computers are down and everything's down. Even the phones are all down but the TV is still down so we can do nothing but sit and watch TV and listen to music and talk and read and write and play and breathe and think and act and do things that are important to us and to each other and so on and off we do it for hours and hours on end and then it gets worse and more and finally it just gets better and worse.And then we get nothing done and it goes away and nothing happens and everyone is just lazy and useless and nobody knows what's wrong with us! So much is happening and everybody is doing it again and still nothing is good. "

It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping. " 

},{"Generated text": " European Court of Justice rules against Turkey The European court of justice has ruled in favor of the Turkish government in a case that could lead to the expulsion of Turkish citizens from the EU. The court ruled on Thursday that Turkey had violated the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) rules by discriminating against German nationals in Turkey. "The court has found that Germany and Turkey are incompatible," the Goethe Institute, a German think tank, told the court. Germany, which has long opposed Turkey's entry into the bloc, is the only EU member state to have the right to exclude Turkish nationals from EU membership. Turkey, however, has argued that it is not incompatible with the ETA rules. In a statement, the German government said it was "deeply disappointed" by the ruling, adding that "the European Union has failed to protect the interests of its citizens." The EU has been trying for more than 70 years to free up its borders, but has not been able to do so in the face of a growing number of legal challenges. It has also been unable to stop the flow of migrants from Turkey to other European countries, including the United States, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. European courts have also ruled against Ankara, saying it violated EU rules on free movement of goods and services (FTAs). The case was brought by a group of German citizens in 2007, who said they had been discriminated against because of their German nationality. They said the decision was based on the fact that they were not legally entitled to a vote on whether or not they should be allowed to enter the union. However, they added that there was no legal basis for such discrimination, and that the case would not be heard before the end of this year. Slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA) and co-defendants The ruling was the latest in an ongoing series of court cases in Europe that have focused on EU citizens' rights and the rights of European citizens to live, work and play in their home countries. One case involved a citizen of Israel who was arrested for allegedly having sex with a man in his home country. Another involved an Israeli citizen who had a sexual relationship with an underage girl in Japan. Both cases were later brought to trial in absentia, where the woman was charged with rape and attempted rape. But the judge said she did not believe the charges against the man were politically motivated, ruling that he had acted in self-defense and was therefore not guilty of any crime. slk-xx, british, pan-German, Irish, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, Slovak, Ukrainian, Russian, Hungarian, Turkish and Australian courts All of these cases stem from a dispute between the two countries over the legality of EU-Turkey free trade agreements, according to German legal experts who have been studying the issue since the early 1990s and have written a book about the legal status of such agreements in recent years. All three cases are currently pending in Germany's lower courts, while the other two are pending before a lower court in Luxembourg, in which the same judge is expected to rule on Friday whether the agreement is legally binding and whether it violates the principles of freedom of expression and human rights, as well as the principle of equal protection for all citizens of both countries and their citizens, respectively. Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Czech Republic are also among the countries with which Turkey has a strong interest in free-trade agreements but have yet to reach an agreement on how to implement the agreements. Slovenia, Sweden and Finland are among those countries which have agreed to allow Turkey access to EU markets, although they have not yet ratified the terms of those agreements and are not bound to sign the deal. Norway, Denmark and Sweden have already signed a deal with Turkey on a similar issue, though they do not want to take part in any further legal action. Poland is also a member of that agreement, with its own court having ruled earlier this month that Ankara had breached its obligations to cooperate with EU countries on certain issues, such as national security and national sovereignty.

,"Reference text": " European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or "Beginning German" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA) "

The Bavarian side have beaten their German rivals, Hoffenheim, 2-1, in the Bundesliga on Sunday. Bayern, who have lost three of their last four league games, are in a three-game losing streak. On Sunday, they lost 3-2 at home to Freiburg, with Mario Gomez and Papiss Demba Cisse scoring the only goals for the visitors. In the first half, Bayern had to settle for a draw, but the home side were able to hold on to the lead through Phillipp Lahm and Franck Ribery. "It was a great win for us," said Bayern coach Louis van Gaal after the match, adding that he was "very pleased" with his side's performance. However, it was not enough for Bayern to win the game, as they were unable to find the equalizer in front of a home crowd of 35,000. Facing the same fate as last season's title-holders, the Bavarians were forced to play their second match in as many days, losing to a side they had beaten in their previous three matches. They were also forced into a defensive stalemate in September, when they conceded three goals in three games. That was the last time Bayern faced a German side that had won a Bundesliga match since the end of September. It was only the second time this season that Bayern have been beaten by a team other than the likes of Cologne, Frankfurt and Mainz, and it is the third time in four matches that they have not beaten a top-flight side. Last year's defeat to Cologne was Bayern's first away defeat in seven league matches, having lost two of its last three away from home. This time around, however, things are looking up. For one thing, there is no reason to believe that the German team is going to have a chance of winning the league title this year. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico- Advertisement - "I don't think it's a coincidence that we've been playing so well for so long. We've had a lot of good games in our last few matches," he said, "but we haven't played as well as we would have liked to. I think we'll have to wait and see what happens." "We've got to be better than we were last year," added the midfielder, whose goal against Cologne gave Bayern an early lead. But it wasn't enough to convince Bayern that it would be a good season for them to keep going. After all, this is not a season in which they've won just one league game in five years, so they're still in good shape. And that's not to say they won't be back next season, either. There's no doubt about that. At the very least, we're back on track." The only thing that has changed in recent weeks is how much the club's fans are willing to give up on the idea of playing in Germany. Despite the fact that their fans have turned out in droves to watch Bayern play, many of them are not happy with the way the team has played. Some of those fans, for example, have taken to social media to express their disappointment at the lack of progress by their side, while others have expressed their support for their team's efforts to get back into the top flight. Others have simply been disappointed with their own results, saying they didn't have the results to show for it. One thing is for sure, though: Bayern will be looking to improve on their recent form, which has seen them win just two matches in all competitions so far this term. Meanwhile, their opponents are struggling to make up for lost ground. Although they are still unbeaten in league play and have only one win in six matches this month, that is still a long way off from their league record of 10 wins in 12 games (three draws in 13 matches) and one loss in 10 matches (one draw in 11 matches). "This is a big step up from where we left off a year ago," Bayern manager Jose Manuel Neuer said in an interview with German newspaper the "Dpa" newspaper. He added that his team-mates had been "disappointed" by the result, stating that "we're not playing well enough" and "that we should be playing better." "

Slovakia's prime minister said on Sunday that the ban would not be lifted until the end of May. Slovaks have long been calling for a ban on the sale of Iranian products in the country. The move comes after Slovakia announced that it would no longer allow the export of products from Iran to be exported to other countries. "The ban will not go into effect until May, when Slovakia will be able to export its products directly to Iran," said Slovakia’s premier, Vladi Bratislava, during a visit to Isfahan, the capital of the Iranian province of Iran. In a statement issued Sunday, Slovakia said it was willing to accept an Iranian ban, but it did not mean that Slovakia would be allowed to sell the products to any other country, including the U.S. or the European Union, or even the United States, as long as they were in compliance with the terms of a cease-fire in Iran, which has been in place since 2009. But Slovakia is not the only country that has taken a stand against the sanctions imposed on Iran by the US and the EU over its involvement in Iraq and its 2011 nuclear deal with Tehran. It is also the first time Slovakia has allowed the use of force against Iran's nuclear program, and it is only the second time it has done so in a long time. On the other hand, there have been a number of incidents in recent years in which the Iranians have used weapons of mass destruction against their own people. One of them was in 2009 when Iranian-born American Amir Hekmati was killed in an airstrike in Oman. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa) - type-of-footer: "In 2009, we were told that we had to pay 1-million US dollars (1.56,000 euros) in order to stop Iran from using nuclear weapons against its own citizens. We are not going to allow this to happen again," he said, adding that he was not aware of any such sanctions. He said he had no idea what was going on in his country at the time but was told by a source close to him that there was a "very good chance" that Iran was planning to use the money to buy weapons from other nations, such as Oman, Oman and Oman in 2011, if it wanted to continue its nuclear programme with Iran as part of its "war on terror" program. However, he added, "I don't think that is the case at this point. I think there is a very strong possibility that they will use this money in some way to do something about it." The sanctions were imposed after the Iran-Iraqi conflict ended in 2010, after which Slovakia was forced to withdraw its troops from the war-ravaged country of Iraq, Iran and Syria. At the same time, Iranian officials accused the government of trying to force Slovakia to hand over 1.6 million euros worth of weapons to Tehran, a charge that was later dropped by US intelligence agencies, according to a government document obtained by The Associated Press news agency, citing unnamed government officials and a court document. A Slovaker official told the AP that "there is no evidence that any of this has happened in any way." "We have not seen any evidence to suggest that this was an attempt to influence the decision-making process in our country," the official said. 'It is an act of political will' The government has also been accused of not doing enough to protect the citizens of Slovakia from being targeted by Iranian agents, who are also known as "terrorists" or "agents of state," according the document added. That accusation, however, has not been proven in court and is unlikely to hold up in future, with Slovakia currently facing a legal battle over the issue of whether or not it should be taken up by other EU member states. For now, it remains unclear whether Slovakia wants to take part in such a fight, given the current political situation. "

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. "Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees," Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any "financial commitments" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. "We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes)," said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa) " 

},{"Generated text": " French presidential candidate Thibault Cirier is a political amateur. He's a member of the right-wing National Front (FN) party, but he's not a candidate for the French presidential election. "I'm a student of politics," he told DW's Jake Cigainero at the Elysee in Paris on Tuesday. The FN candidate, François Fillon, is running for president of France's Fifth Republic party in the May 7 election, which will be decided by a vote of 1 million euros ($1.1 million) to 1.5 million (2.6 million US dollars). The candidate is Emmanuel Macron, a former French president who was elected to the European Parliament in 2015. In the run-up to Tuesday's vote, the FN is expected to win a majority of seats in parliament. But it's unclear whether the party's candidate will win enough votes to make it into the presidential race, or whether he'll be able to stand on his own two feet. DW spoke to French political student Vincent Couronne, who has been studying politics for a year and a half, about his experience in politics, and how he feels about the current situation in France. It's clear that he has a lot of work to do to improve the country's image in Europe, he said, adding that his main focus is on the economy and the fight against terrorism. However, it is not clear how far he will go in his bid to become the next president. His campaign has already been criticized by some quarters, including the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, for failing to deliver on promises made to voters during the campaign. French students have been calling for Macron's re-election since last year, when he won the popular vote in a landslide victory over Socialist candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. At the beginning of April, Macron had promised a "Frexit" campaign, in which he promised to create jobs and improve living standards for young people. Now, however, his campaign is facing a new challenge: how do you get the job done? "It's very difficult to get a job as a journalist," said French-German student Charlotte Theuvenin from the Paris-based business school "Cafe des Phares," a cafe in Place de la Bastille, where he works as an electrician. On April 23, France will hold a referendum on whether or not to leave the EU, with the aim of creating a free and open Europe. If Macron wins the presidency, there will also be a chance for French voters to vote for him. This is the first time that a French student has participated in an election campaign since he graduated from high school in Germany in 2011. A student from Paris, Vincent Caspinar, said he was impressed by the way Macron has managed to keep his distance from his political opponents. Cispinar said that Macron is "not a politician at all." "He's just a young man with a big heart and he doesn't know what he wants to be." The student said Macron would have a difficult time winning the election if he didn't have the support of his supporters, especially those who don't want to give up their right to live in fear of being voted out of office. France is also facing the prospect of a second round of presidential elections in May and June, if Macron does not win the general election in two weeks' time. That would be the second time in as many years that France has faced a crisis of its own. For the past two years, Hollande and Macron have struggled to convince voters that they are ready to step up the pressure on their political parties. They have also faced the specter of an "Unite the Right" movement in recent years. As a result, many voters have become disillusioned with Macron and his policies. Many of them have even begun to question whether Macron should be allowed to remain in office, even if it means losing his parliamentary majority. Some of these disillusionment is due to his lack of political experience. Others are concerned about how Macron will deal with issues such as the refugee crisis, migration and climate change. One student, Nicolas Hamon, says he thinks Macron could be more effective in dealing with these issues. Another is convinced that the president will not be as popular as he once was. "
,"Reference text": " French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris café where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. "It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates." Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. "It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country," she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, "How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests." Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, "Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of." Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. "France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue," said student Thibault Cirier. "The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally." Café viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that "he throws barbs." As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. "For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon," Taspinar said hesitating. "I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon." Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. "Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope," she said. "But Macron is the only possible candidate." With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. "Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen," Theuvenin said. "I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round." Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23. " 

},{"Generated text": " German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble to visit Berlin in 2006 The German Interior Ministry is to meet with Berlin's interior minister, Erhart Körting, on Tuesday to discuss the situation in the German capital. The meeting will be held in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's second-largest city after Berlin. In 2006, German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Berlin for the first time since reunification in 2005. On Tuesday, the meeting was to take place in Berlin, where German police officers' union Berliners' Union (DFU) president Konrad Freiberg said he would be visiting the city. "I am very happy to be here," he said, adding that he was "looking forward to seeing what the future holds for Berlin." "We are very pleased to see that Berlin has come to an agreement with the government on the issue of security," said the union president, who was also in attendance at the event. Berlin is the second largest city in Germany, after Hanover and Düsseldorf, with a population of 1.5 million people, according to the Federal Statistics Office (FOSU). In 2005, Berlin was one of the few German cities without a police force. Since then, there have been a number of attacks on police forces and police stations across the country. Last year, police in Bremen were attacked by a group of men who were trying to break into the police station. Police officers in other cities have also been targeted by the attackers, including the Cologne-based Bergisch Gladbach station, which has been the scene of several major attacks in recent years. Germany has also seen a rise in violent crime, particularly among young people. However, it is not clear how many of these attacks were carried out by police alone, or whether the perpetrators were responsible for them. There are also reports that some officers were shot and killed in a shootout between police and the suspects, and that there were at least 10 people wounded. This is a worrying development for German law enforcement, especially since the attack on Berlin took place on Monday. It is unclear whether Berlin will follow through on its promise to protect the public from the attacks, but it appears that it will not be able to do so without the help of its own security forces. According to a statement released by Berlin police, no one was seriously injured during the incident. But it was clear that the Berlin attack was not the result of an act of terrorism, as police had been warned by German prosecutors. A police officer was killed and several others were injured in an incident that occurred on a train near the border with Germany. He was taken to hospital and later died of a heart attack. His wife, Heidi Klum, was among those injured. Her husband, a former policeman, is also a member of parliament and is serving a five-year term in prison for his role as a security guard at a military base in Hamburg. At the end of his term, he is due to return to Germany in early 2006. As a result, his wife is expecting a baby in two weeks. While he has not yet returned to his home state of Frankfurt, she is hoping to find a place to stay for a few more months before returning to her hometown. She is hopeful that her husband will return in time to help her get back to work. After all, this is her first year back in her native Germany after a long absence of more than a year. If she does not return, then she will have to wait until 2006 to make sure that she can get a job back. That's not a bad thing, because she has a lot of friends who want her to come back and work with her. So far, so good. And that's what she's been doing. I don't think she'll be coming back anytime soon. What I'm really hoping for is that people will come home and see her again. For me, that means that I'll have a better chance of making it through the next year and a half of my life back home." In the meantime, however, things are not looking good for her and her family. Many of them are worried about her health. They are concerned about the health of their children. One of her fears is she might be unable to attend school. "
,"Reference text": " German Interior Ministry Claims Progress on Crime Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble released his department's official statistics concerning crime in 2006 in Berlin on Tuesday. And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. "The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults," said Schäuble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart Körting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. "As many experts have pointed out," Körting said, "the potential for violence in society is increasing." The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by Düsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town. " 

},{"Generated text": " Borussia Dortmund vs. Bayern Munich Preview: The Blues are in the hunt for a Champions League spot for the first time in their history. Petr Cech is the man to lead the Blues to the last 16 of the German Cup. The goalkeeper has been a revelation in his first season in charge of a club that has struggled to keep up with the pace of European football. He has made a name for himself as one of Germany's top goalkeepers, but he has yet to make an impact in this competition. Last season, he was the goalkeeper of Real Madrid's first-ever Bundesliga title, and he is now the coach of Bayern's second-placed side. "I'm very proud of my goalkeeper," he said after his side's win over Barcelona on Thursday. But it's not just the goal that matters. It's also the fact that he's been able to play a key role in a Bayern side that are struggling to stay on top of their Bundesliga table. That's a big reason why Bayern have been so successful this season. They've won the Bundesliga three times in four seasons, with a total of seven trophies in all competitions. And they've had a lot of success in Germany, too. In their last two matches, they have won three Bundesliga titles and three German Cups. This year, Bayern are the only side to have managed to win the league title in three consecutive seasons. Coach Roberto di Matteo, who has overseen the club's resurgence in recent years, has also been impressed with his ability to adapt to a new system. On Thursday, when Bayern beat Barcelona 3-2 at the Allianz Arena in Munich, it was a different story altogether. At the same time, the team's coach, Jose Manuel Neuer, was impressed by the way he handled the ball in front of his own team-mates, including goalkeeper Holger Badstuber and captain Arjen Robben, as well as the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Franck Ribery. Both of those players had been on the pitch for some time and were expected to take part in Saturday's match. For Bayern, this is a chance to prove that they can still compete in Europe's premier club competition, which starts on Saturday. After a difficult first half, coach Luiz Gustavo and his players have found a way to get through the second half without much difficulty. However, there is still plenty of work to be done in order to ensure that Bayern can get back into the top-four. As a result, Dortmund will be hoping to avoid a repeat of last season's final, where they were knocked out by Bayern in extra time by a penalty shoot-out victory over Manchester United. Raul Meireles, for example, scored the decisive goal for Bayern against Barcelona, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick for Borussia. Ramires, meanwhile, made his debut for his new club, having started the season as an unused substitute for David Alaba at left back for Barcelona in 2005-06. Merely a few minutes before the break, Ronaldo was on his way off the bench to score his second goal in as many games. His first goal came on a header off a cross from the right-hand side of Mario Gomez. A minute later, a free kick was saved by goalkeeper Andre Schurrle, giving Bayern a 1-0 lead over the visitors. With the scoreline tied at 2-1, Madrid will have to settle for third place in Group B. Real, however, are still in contention to qualify for next year's competition after a tough first round of matches in which they lost to Barcelona and Manchester City on away goals to Bayern last week. Madrid have already qualified for their first European competition in five years thanks to their two-goal advantage over Bayern. Although they'll be without their star striker, Cristian Ronaldo, will not be back in action until the end of next week's Bundesliga campaign. There is no doubt that Ronaldo will make his return to his old club in style, although he will miss out on an opportunity to do so with an ankle injury. Ronaldo's return will also be a major boost for Real's title hopes. "
,"Reference text": " All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. "We must not even think about [losing]," said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. "If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that." Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. "We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away," Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. "It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it." But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

The charges stem from allegations that he sexually abused the teenager Fernando Karadima in 1980. Carlo Alberto Capella was accused by the US and Canada of being a pedophile by a priest in the Catholic Church. A Vatican court in Washington on Saturday charged the priest with sexual assault and child abuse, and ordered him to pay €2,500 (€50,000) in fines and court costs. "This is a very serious allegation," the Vatican said in a statement, adding that the charges were "not substantiated by evidence." The Vatican also ordered the prosecution of three other Chilean priests, including Cardinal George Pell, who was convicted in Canada in September of charges of child sex abuse. Pell was charged last September with child pornography, a charge which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He faces up to 20 years behind bars if found guilty of the crime. Capell was sentenced to a total of 40 years' imprisonment and a fine of $42,100 if convicted. In his plea, Pell said he would plead guilty to the charge of abuse of a minor and receive a suspended sentence of five years. His lawyer said the accusations against him were politically motivated and that Pell should be allowed to continue his work as a Vatican lawyer. Cardinal Pell has also been named as an expert witness on the case. Last September, Pope Francis announced Pell would be suspended from his post at the end of this year for life if he failed to provide evidence against the accused priest. Aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)The Vatican has said it will continue to investigate the allegations against Pell and the Chilean archbishop of Chile, Cardinal Joseph Pell. It is not clear how much Pell will be paid, but Vatican officials have said they have not ruled out the possibility of Pell being reinstated. aw/kyms, AFP, news agency, bbc, wire services, cb/b (Reuters, AP) The accusations come amid growing pressure from the United States, Canada and other countries to step up their efforts to crack down on pedophilia and cover-up the scandal, which has rocked the world's largest Catholic church and left millions of children without a father or a mother to take care of, according to Vatican documents. An investigation into the alleged abuse is ongoing, Vatican spokesman Francis told reporters in an interview on Sunday. However, he added, "We are not going to give up on our mission to protect the children of our church," and added that "it is our responsibility to make sure that all children are protected from abuse and exploitation." He also said that there was "no evidence" of any wrongdoing by Pell or other bishops in Chile who were involved in any way, shape or form of dealing with the church's abuse scandal. But he also pointed out that it was not the first time the pope had called for Pell to be reinstated, saying he "would not be able to do that without the support of his own church." "There is no evidence of wrongdoing," Francis said, referring to Pell's appointment as Vatican ambassador to Chile in 1990. This is the second time Francis has called on Chileans to support Pell in his bid to reinstate Pell after he was forced to resign last year over allegations he had sex with children under the age of 14. According to an Associated Press report, Francis called Pell "a man of integrity and integrity" and urged them to "stand up for what he believes is right and correct" in order to prevent abuse from happening to children and protect them from being abused by their parents and their children. On the other hand, some Chilean bishops have been calling on Francis to call for his resignation over the past few months, amid mounting criticism from Washington over his handling of allegations of widespread sexual misconduct by priests and bishops who have accused them of failing to act in accordance with their duties as head of diocesan affairs. Many Chilean politicians have also criticized Francis for calling for the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, accusing him of "insulting" the Church's credibility in handling cases like the one in which Pell had been accused.

Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged "a large quantity" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between €2,500 and €50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000).

The EU has urged Russia to take action against Ukraine's state pension fund, the State Pension Fund (SPF), in a move that could lead to sanctions against the country's oil giant, Rosneft. "The EU should step in and intervene militarily," the EU said on Monday, according to the RIA news agency, citing unnamed sources. Russia has said it would take steps to prevent the crisis from spreading to other countries, including the United States, Britain, France and Germany. Moscow has also called for an EU-wide investigation into the Russian government's handling of the Ukrainian crisis, which has rocked the oil industry in recent weeks. Russian President Vladimir Putin has criticized the move, calling it a "disgraceful step" and "a threat to our national security." The move comes after a series of protests by pro-Russian separatists in western Ukraine that have claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. In response, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said he would step down from his post at the end of this month. He also said that Russia would continue to cooperate with the international community in its fight against terrorism and other forms of violence. Putin's decision to call for a European-style intervention is seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to weaken the West's grip on Russia. uhe/nz (Reuters, rIA) - In a statement, Putin said: "Russia is committed to a peaceful resolution of its conflict with Ukraine, and we will continue our efforts to do so." Putin, however, did not directly address the issue, saying that he was "not ready" to discuss the matter with EU member states. However, he did say that Moscow was ready to help Ukraine in any way it could, adding that it was willing to work with European countries to make sure that Ukraine was not involved in an arms race with Russia and that the sanctions would not be imposed against Russia at all. ria-via-russia (AP, dpa, Reuters)- Advertisement - Russia is the world's largest oil exporter, with a total of 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in assets under Russian ownership. It is also the largest state-owned oil company in Russia, Russia’s second-largest by market value, after state oil firm, Petrobras, as well as its largest trading partner, U.S. oil and gas company, ExxonMobil, among others, to provide the rest of Russia with more than $39 billion in state funds. But Russia does not have a monopoly on oil exports. Oil prices have risen sharply this year as a result of a slump in crude prices and a drop in oil prices, raising concerns about the outlook for the global oil market. Last week, a report from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said Russian oil companies were preparing to sell assets worth up to 2.6 trillion rubles (1.7 trillion euros) worth of crude oil. That would be enough to cover the cost of oil imports, but the government would have to pay a hefty price for those assets if they were to be sold, Ria reported, quoting a source close to Russian energy ministry officials who said the sale was unlikely to go ahead as the price was too high for Moscow to bear. kl/nk (AFP, AP, DPA) – The Russian state media quoted the ministry as saying: “We are not prepared to give up any of these assets.” The ministry said Russia will not sell the assets it has already sold to foreign investors, although it is not clear how much it will sell to Western investors. This would make it difficult for Russian investors to get a return on their investment, it said.   The minister also warned that Russian companies would need to find a way to reduce their reliance on foreign currency reserves to meet their obligations under international sanctions. "

The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a "multi-billion-dollar" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote "at least 100 billion roubles" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. "These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies," RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. "We are planning to create a reserve of significant size." Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA) "

The film will premiere in Zürich, Switzerland, on July 7 2001. "I'm going to make a movie based in the Alps," said the film's director, who was born in Switzerland in 1937 and grew up in Germany. He is the son of a Swiss inventor and the daughter of one of the country's most famous film makers. His father, Markus, was the founder of Vega, a German film company, and his mother was a member of his family. In the novel, Heidi is an inventor who invented the world of skiing and snowboarding. She is also the inventor's wife and mother of two young children. Her husband, Peter, is a wealthy businessman who works for Vega. They have two sons and a daughter. Their father died in a plane crash in July 2001, leaving them with only one son and one daughter to care for. Now, they have a son who lives in their home town of Graubuenden, near the German city of Frankfurt. Heidi and Peter have been living together for more than 40 years, but their relationship has been strained by a lack of financial support from their parents. It's not just the money that has strained the relationship between the family and their son. There are also financial problems, as well as the fact that Heidi has to work for a living, which is why she has had to take care of her son for the past two years. But she's also had a difficult time finding a job because of all the financial troubles she and her husband are going through. So far, the only job they've managed to do is to find a place for Heidi to stay, where she can spend the rest of their time and not have to worry about what happens when Heidi goes out of town. That's a big problem, because Heidi doesn't have enough money to buy a house, so she stays at home with her two children and is unable to afford a car. For Heidi, it's all about finding the right people to live with and to be able to spend time with, say, her parents and step-grandparents. And that's what Heidi's family has done for her. When Heidi first came to Germany, she didn't know what she was doing until she met her childhood friend Dete. Then she found out that she had been married to a Japanese man who had become her best friend. Since then, their friendship has grown stronger and stronger, with the two of them living in different parts of Germany and Japan. At the same time, there's been a lot of talk about Heidi as a woman with a strong sense of self-confidence and an ability to get along with people who don't seem to know her very well. On the one hand, this makes Heidi look like a very strong woman, while on the other she looks like an old woman who has lost her mind and who is trying to figure out how to cope with it all. As Heidi grows older, more and more people come to see her in her own way. This is something that is very important to her, especially since she is so close to the people she meets in real life. After all, when you meet her you can't help but think, "Oh, my God, I'm so happy to have found someone who can help me with this." Heidi also has a new job: She's working as an interior decorator at the Heidi House, an apartment building in Frankfurt, Germany's second-largest city, just outside the city center of Gelsenkirchen. With her new husband's help she manages to keep the place clean and tidy and keeps the house tidy, even if Heidi does need a little help from the outside world. Even though Heidi isn't the most well-known person in town, people still come and visit her every now and then. One thing Heidi knows for sure is that there is no shortage of people like her who want to help her out. If Heidi can do this, then she'll be the first person to ever do it. I think Heidi would be a great addition to this list. "
,"Reference text": " Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million "Heidi", funded by the Zürich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel "Heidi" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple’s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden’s remake is the 18th "Heidi" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, "the film was transmitted to today’s world without losing sight of the original novel". But Imboden’s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter’s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a "refreshing Heidi", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi "myth" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a "transfigured mountain heroine". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists – half from Japan – are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden’s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden’s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen. "

The death of her sister has left a trail of shock and grief. Samia, who was the youngest of four children born to Pakistani parents to British parents, was one of the first to die in the country. Her body was found in an open field near the border with Pakistan, where she had been living for more than a year. She was 19 years old when she was attacked by a group of men in her hometown of Lahore, Pakistan. It is not clear how she died, but it is believed to have been the result of an act of terrorism. In July, a British freelance journalist, Juanita Phillips, published a report on the case, calling it "a case of mistaken identity." The Guardian newspaper reported that the woman, identified only as "Samia," died after being attacked with a knife by two men. "It was a tragic event," she told the Guardian, adding that she and her family had no idea what had happened to her until the day after the attack. Pakistani journalist Shehnaz Khan was also among the victims, reporting from a hospital in Peshawar. Pakistan's government has denied the allegations, saying that it was not aware of any such incident. However, Pakistani authorities have said that they have no evidence to back up the claims. According to the United Nations, the death toll from the incident could be as high as 10,000, and the number of people who have died is likely to rise as a result. There is also the possibility that there may be a link between the deaths of two young women, as well as the rise in suicide attacks in recent years, which has led to fears of a new wave of attacks on women and girls. This is the second time in as many months that a woman has been killed by an attack on her own family, according to a UN report released last month. As the investigation into the killing continues, there are fears that more women will be killed in future. Read more: How the Pakistani government is handling the murder of young girls in its own country, says Gouri Sharma The UN has called for an end to violence against women across the world. But it has also called on Pakistan to step up its anti-bullying campaign, warning that "it is time for the government to take action against the perpetrators of this crime." In a statement released by the Pakistan government on Tuesday, it said it would "take action" against those responsible for spreading the false information. A spokesman for Al Jazeera said the organisation would not comment on whether or not it had received any information about the victim's death. He added: "We will continue to work with the authorities to find out what is going on and if there is any truth to what has happened. We will also continue our efforts to ensure that we have the information we need in order to make sure that our people are safe and secure in our country," he said. 'It is a very sad day for Pakistan' The Pakistani media has become increasingly politicized over the past few months. They have become more and more vocal in their support for women's rights and for human rights. Many of them believe that women should be treated with respect and dignity and that their rights should not be restricted to just being a victim of violence. Women should also be given the opportunity to express their views and to speak out in support of women who are suffering from mental health issues, particularly those who suffer from depression, anxiety and anxiety. For many, this is an issue that has not been adequately addressed by mainstream media outlets, such as ABC Australia, Guardian and Daily Life. And it's not just the media that is politicizing the issue. These are the voices that are being drowned out by fake news and sensationalism. What is wrong with this? There are many voices out there who do not want to be seen as victims of these kinds of crimes. I think the most important thing is that people have a right to know what they are going through. That is what we are trying to do. If we don't do something about it, then we will not have any kind of justice for them, because it will only lead to more violence and violence." "I think we should do more to address this issue," said journalist and journalist Juanitas Phillips. "
,"Reference text": " Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as "honor killings." We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in "honor killings" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it "deeply offensive" and referring to it as a "family killing" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. "I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. "While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable." "The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world," she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. "There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family," Hamad said. "By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women." Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? "When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable," Hamad said. "The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there." Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. "We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them," said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution. "

The Nobel Peace Prize winner was born in 1988 in Yangon, a city in the western state of Insein. In 1988, Zaw Win was elected as the country's first civilian prime minister. Since then, he has been a member of the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) and the Democratic Party (DPP). But his political career has come to an end after he was ousted by the military in a military coup in 1990. He has since returned to Myanmar, where he is now a professor of economics at the London School of Economics (LSE) in Brussels. "Myanmar is a country that has a long history of human rights violations," he told me in an interview published on Friday, October 2, in which he described his experience in prison as one of "the worst in human history." "I have spent my entire life fighting for the rights of my people, and I have never seen anything like this in my life. I am proud to be a part of that struggle," said Zew Win, who was also a student at LSE. But he added that he had no idea what was going on in his life until he heard the news from his wife, Mya Than Than Nu, that she had been released from prison. She said she was not aware of what had happened to her husband, but that it was "very difficult" for her to get out of prison and return to the political life of a civilian leader. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas More than 100,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar in recent years, many of them to neighboring Bangladesh. They have been living in refugee camps in Myanmar for more than a decade, according to Harn Yawnghwe, an analyst with the European Union's Euro-Burma Office. Many of those fleeing Myanmar are now in exile in Europe or the United States, which is also home to a large number of internally displaced people (IDPs), who are fleeing persecution in their own country. A recent survey of 3,500 IDPs by a group of international experts found that nearly one-third of respondents said they had fled their home country in order to escape persecution. According to one survey, the majority of people who fled from Myanmar fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in search of better conditions and better opportunities. Another survey showed that about 1.5 percent of Rohingya had returned home, compared to just 2.3 percent in 1991. This was the second time in three years that the government had failed to reach out to them in return for their help. It is not clear how many more people fled, or if they would be able to return home in time for a new election. There are also fears that they will be forced to leave their homes and move to other countries, such as Bangladesh, to avoid the same fate that Myanmar has experienced since the end of its military dictatorship in 1989. So far, however, there are no reports of any new arrivals from outside Myanmar. However, it is unclear whether the situation has improved since then and whether there is any change in attitudes towards the Rohingya, as a result of U Nu's ouster from the post-military government, is likely to continue. Some analysts believe that this may be the case, given the fact that many ethnic groups are still living under the shadow of military rule. Others say it could be because the security forces have not been adequately trained and equipped to handle the influx of refugees. For example, some analysts say that there may not be enough manpower to carry out a full-scale crackdown on the Rohingyas, while others say they are concerned about the lack of political stability and security. That is, they say, because they don't have enough money to cover the costs of running a government that is in dire financial straits. These are the main reasons why many people have left Myanmar and are seeking refuge in EU-backed countries like the EU. One reason why this is happening is because Myanmar is facing a political crisis, says a senior official from Brussels who is currently in charge of an EU investigation into the Myanmar government's internal affairs.

,"Reference text": " Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon’s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was “happy for the prisoners who were part of the release”. “This is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners’ release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.” Amnesty comes ahead of next year’s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. “The whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,” said Zarni. “Because the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.” Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won Myanmar’s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. “The military is going to be in power for a long time,” warns Zarni, “because they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.” New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country’s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: “It is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.” Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and “to take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.” The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar’s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi’s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas "

The World Health Organization (WHO) says the Paris climate agreement has been a disaster for the environment. According to the report, the number of people affected by the global warming crisis has risen by more than 40 percent since 2012. "The world is facing a crisis of health," the UNEP said in a statement, adding that the situation in Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and the Western Pacific regions is "increasingly dire." "We are seeing a dramatic increase in the prevalence of heat-trapping diseases," said the WHO Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that there was a "significant increase" in deaths due to climate-related diseases, which are linked to high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change is also a major threat to human health, he said. In addition, there is a rise in human-caused diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, among other conditions, as a result of increased greenhouse gases and increased air pollution. Global warming is expected to worsen over the next two decades, and by 2050, global temperatures will rise by 40 to 50 degrees Celsius (104 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit) in some parts of Asia and Africa, according to a new report. This is in line with WHO's goal of reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by 20 percent by 2030. However, it is not clear how much of this will be absorbed by humans and whether it will have a negative impact on global health and well-being. It is unclear how long the effects will last, but experts say it could be several decades before humans are able to fully recover from the damage caused by warming temperatures and rising sea levels. There are also concerns about the long-term effects of climate warming on people's health. Some experts believe that it would take decades for people to recover fully from their current health problems, while others say the impact will only be felt by people who are already living in extreme heat and extreme weather conditions. Experts say that if people continue to live in high temperatures, they will become more likely to die from heat stroke and other forms of respiratory diseases. They also warn that rising temperatures could lead to higher mortality rates, especially in developing countries, where the risk of severe heat exposure is highest. These are the main reasons why people are becoming more dependent on fossil fuels for food and drinking water. But it's not just the climate that is causing the problem, experts warn. Environmentalists say there's a long way to go before we reach a tipping point where people will no longer have access to clean water and clean air. If we don't act now, we're going to have to wait until 2050 to see if we can get to that point. That's when we'll see a drastic change in how we treat people. We need to make sure that we have the right policies in place to protect our environment and to ensure that our children and grandchildren are safe and healthy. And that's what we've been doing for many, many years now. I think we will see more and more people being exposed to this kind of pollution in their homes and in our schools and workplaces. What we need now is an end-to-end approach to health care, so that people can live longer, healthier lives and have more opportunities to develop their own healthy habits." The report says that in order to achieve this goal, governments must first develop policies that will help them reduce their carbon footprint and reduce the use of fossil fuel. So far, this has not been achieved, with the exception of a few countries that have adopted a carbon-free diet and a low-carbon economy. At the same time, countries like Germany and France have already begun to implement a plan to reduce carbon emissions, a move that has already been criticized by some environmental groups. Countries like Bonn and Paris, for example, have also started to introduce carbon pricing and subsidies to help meet the growing demand for clean energy. "
,"Reference text": " A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report "Healthy Environment, Health People," the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. "By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being," said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. "Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people," the report warned.

"The government must act quickly and decisively," the report said, adding that the move was necessary to protect the interests of the farmers and the environment. It said that in order to do so, farmers would have to reduce subsidies to the tune of 454 million euros ($474 million) a year. In addition, subsidies would be cut by 1.5 percentage points from the current level of subsidies, the study said. However, it added that this would not be the first time that subsidies were cut in such a way that farmers were able to save money on their own food costs. Farmers' association, which represents more than 80,000 farmers, said in a statement on Wednesday that it was "deeply concerned" about the impact of cuts in subsidies on farmers' incomes. Mb/sms (dpa, epd)The German Vegetarian Association, a trade group that represents farmers across the country, has called for an end to subsidies and a return to tax-free farming in Germany. Last year, Germany's agriculture ministry announced plans to introduce subsidies of up to 1 percent for every 1,500 farmers who sell their products. This would give farmers a tax break of 1 percentage point, compared with the previous year's average of 0.6 percent, according to IST data. mb / sms / bild (AFP, PTI, hw)In the past few years, agricultural subsidies have increased by 4.4 percentage-point, with farmers receiving a total of 2.7 percent of their income from subsidies in 2015, up from 2 percent in 2010. But the increase has not been enough to offset the cost of subsidy cuts, and farmers are still struggling to make ends meet with rising prices for meat and dairy products, as well as with a rise in prices of raw materials such as fertilizers, pesticides and fertilisers. So far, however, there has been little progress on this front, although the ministry has said it will continue to look at subsidies as a means of reducing the subsidy burden for farmers. Further, Schmidt's government is expected to take steps to improve the competitiveness of its agricultural sector by introducing subsidies that will be phased in over the next two to three years. On Wednesday, he announced that he would no longer be stepping down as agricultural minister, but would instead take up the role of agriculture's minister for food and agriculture, responsible for ensuring that all subsidies are paid to farmers at the same time as they are being applied to other sectors, including meat production, dairy, poultry, meat processing and animal feed. He also said he hoped to increase the number of farmers working in his ministry by at least 10 percent by 2020, when he takes over from previous agriculture ministers, who had been in charge of food production for over a decade, in an effort to boost the sector's competitiveness and reduce the costs of producing food for domestic consumption and to promote the export of agricultural products to foreign markets. Although he did not specify a specific target, his comments came as part of a series of interviews with German newspaper Bild published Wednesday in which farmers said they expected Schmidt would remain in office until the end of 2015. They said Schmidt should also take action to ensure that his government's policies are implemented in line with international standards and that there is a "clear and transparent approach" to food policy. 'We are not going to give up' On the issue of subsidizing meat, they say, "We will not give in to pressure" and "we will do everything in our power to stop subsidization of meat." They also say that they expect Schmidt and his team to continue their efforts to tackle the problem of low-quality meat in rural areas, where prices are already high. "

Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like "vegan sausage" and "vegetarian schnitzel" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a "vegan sausage" or cutting a slice of "vegetarian schnitzel," German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily "Bild" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. "I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes," Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as "vegetarian ham" or "soy steak." Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that "names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products." More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd) "

The party's leader, Stephen Harper, is expected to win the popular vote, but his party will have to fend off a challenge from the New Democratic Party (NDP). The New Democrats, the party of former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, will be the first major party to take the reins of government in Canada. Harper's Conservatives have been in power since 2011, when they were first elected to the House of Commons in a landslide victory over then-Liberal leader Barack Obama. In his first campaign speech since taking office in January, Harper said he would not seek re-election until after the election. "I'm not going to back down from this," he said, adding that he had no plans to run again until the end of the year. Obama has been criticized for his handling of key issues, including the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which he has called a "disaster" for Canada's oil industry. He has also called on the federal government to speed up the approval process for the controversial pipeline. Trudeau has said the pipeline would be built within the country's borders, and that the government will work with the private sector to ensure that it is built to meet the needs of Canadians. But he also said it was up to Canadians to decide whether to vote for him or against him. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) - You can read the full text of his speech here: "You can't vote against me because I'm a Canadian." The Conservatives, who have a majority in both houses of Parliament, have said they will vote in favor of a referendum on whether or not to allow the project to proceed. They have called for a special election to be held in 2011 to elect a new leader of their party, as well as an election in which the Conservatives and the Liberals will face off against each other in what is now a bitterly divided country. Last year's election was marked by a series of ups and downs, with both parties losing ground in opinion polls and a number of seats being decided by the public vote. On Tuesday, they announced that they would seek to form a government with a mandate of at least 50 percent of voters. Es/ cmk, AP, CBS News (In an interview published on Monday, Sept. 4, 2011), said that if they win, it would give them a chance to "make a difference in this country for generations to come." In a statement released Tuesday evening, Trudeau said his government would continue to work toward the goal of building a strong, united and prosperous Canada, even though the economy has suffered from a slump in recent years. However, he added that "it will take a long time to get there" to achieve that goal, pointing to a lack of economic growth and rising unemployment among young people, among other factors. His party has struggled to gain traction among voters, particularly among younger voters who don't have the financial means to afford to buy a house or a car, according to polls conducted by public broadcaster CBC. As a result, polls have shown that fewer than one in 10 Canadians want to own a home in their country, compared to just two percent in 2010, a year before the recession hit the United States and two in four since the Great Recession hit. For many Canadians, that means they have no choice but to give up on their dream of becoming a country where they can live in peace and prosperity, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, or if their dreams are shattered by an economic crisis that has forced them to flee their homes or to seek a better life in an uncertain future. Is it possible for Trudeau to succeed in his quest to build a stronger Canadian economy? "It's possible," said Walsh, referring to his position as a former federal cabinet minister and minister of finance and economic development. "[But] it's not impossible," Walsh added, "that he can do it." "He's got a lot of work to do and I think he'll be able to make it happen." He also pointed out that there are several other candidates who are running for prime ministerships in other major parties, such as the Green Party or the Social Democrats. "

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. "I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader," Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. "The people are never wrong," Harper said of his defeat. "The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone," Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. "Canadians have spoken," Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the "hopeful, positive" country "with a vision" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government "believed deeply in the diversity of our country," striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. "We beat fear with hope," said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

The US and Saudi Arabia are expected to hold talks on May 12, a day after the Saudi-led coalition launched an air campaign against the Shiite Houthis in Yemen. A meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is scheduled to take place at 11.00 pm (1200 GMT) in the French city of Paris. "We will continue to work closely with our Gulf partners to resolve this conflict," the US State Department said in a statement, adding that the GCC was "committed to a peaceful resolution of this matter." The meeting was the first between the two sides since the conflict broke out on March 26. US Secretary-of-State John F. Kerry said on Friday that Iran had "gravely" violated the terms of an arms embargo imposed on Yemen by the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who was ousted from power in March by a coalition of Shiite Iran-backed rebels led by Iran. Iran has denied accusations that it was behind the attacks, saying it did not know what was going on. In an interview with French television, Kerry also said Iran was also "very concerned" about the escalation of tensions between Riyadh and its Gulf allies. He added that "Iran is also very concerned about this escalation, and it is a matter of concern for Iran as well as for the United States." US President Barack Obama has called for an end to the war, which has killed more than 10,000 people since it began. On Friday, Obama called on Riyadh to step up efforts to end the fighting, calling for a "total and complete cessation of hostilities" between Saudi forces and the rebels, including the internationally recognized government in Sanaa. Shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP) and Tehran have also expressed concern over the continuing conflict. 'Shame on you' The United Nations has accused Riyadh of "shameful and unjustified" treatment of Yemenis, accusing it of supporting the regime's war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, the UN has also accused the Saudis of failing to do enough to stop the violence. It said Riyadh had acted "with the utmost restraint" in its approach to Yemen, warning that a military intervention could lead to an "unprecedented escalation" of violence against civilians. Last month, Riyadh said it would "resolutely stand by" the Yemeni government as it tried to prevent a new wave of attacks on the country's Shiite-majority population. Earlier this week, it said the coalition had killed at least 10 people, most of them civilians, in an apparent attempt to quell the unrest. But Riyadh has yet to provide any details on how it plans to respond to this latest round of fighting. According to US officials, there is no indication that Riyadh is planning to intervene militarily in any way at this time, but it has already begun to consider the possibility of doing so. As the Arab world's most populous country, Yemen has seen a surge in violence in recent months, with thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. There have been reports of a number of suicide bombings and bombings in cities and towns across the Middle Eastern region, according to human rights groups, as a result of which there has been no official confirmation of any such attacks. Many of these attacks have taken place since March, when a ceasefire was signed between Iran and Yemen in which both sides agreed to halt the advance of forces loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh. At the end of March last year, Saudi officials announced that they would no longer allow the military to carry out air strikes against any civilian targets. They said they had no reason to believe that this would be the case, however, given the fact that many of those targets were Shiite rebels who had been fighting for years and who were seeking to overthrow the current government. shs, bw, ryanews.com (AP, AFP, news agency) - type of footer "

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has urged all parties to find a political solution to the conflict. "We have made a decision that the cease-fire will begin this Tuesday, May 12, at 11.00 pm and will last for five days subject to renewal if it works out," Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a meeting of Gulf ministers in Paris on Friday alongside US Secretary of State John Kerry. The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would "come to their senses" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. "We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone," he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. "The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people," the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people "should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building," adding that a cease-fire was "not peace" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a "military target," giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP) "

Kyiv's president Petro Poroshenko said on Sunday that he would no longer be able to take over the post. "I am not going to resign," he said in a statement on Twitter, referring to the scandal that has rocked the country. He also said he will not accept the resignation of his deputy, Andrij Shevchenko, who had been in office since May 15. The resignation came after a series of corruption scandals, including one in which the head of state was accused of sexually abusing a minor girl. In the aftermath of that scandal, the Ukrainian government announced that it would not renew its contract with the West until the end of the year. A number of Ukrainian media outlets have reported on the situation. DW's Kitty Logan reported that the government of Ukraine, which has been under a state of emergency since the beginning of this year, had decided not to renew the contract. She said the new contract would only be renewed if it was approved by the parliament and the president. However, she said, "We will continue to work on this issue as soon as we can." She added that she was "very happy" to see the deal, adding that "it will be a good thing for Ukraine to have a strong leader who can lead it forward." The Ukrainian parliament is due to hold a special session of parliament later this month. rg/lw (Reuters, dpa) - The main opposition parties are the pro-Western parties, and some of them have called for a general election in early June. They are also calling for an end to corruption in Ukraine and a return to democratic rule of law, according to a draft law passed by parliament in June last year that would make it easier for the opposition to form a government. But it is unclear whether this will happen, or whether it will take place at the same time as the crisis in Crimea, where the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has raged on for years. It is not clear how long the current crisis will last, but it seems to be getting worse and worse as more and more people are being killed or injured in clashes between pro and anti-government forces. According to DW, there are at least 10,000 people who have been killed in fighting in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks, many of whom have fled their homes and are now fighting for their lives in neighboring countries. There is also speculation that there is a possibility that a new government could be formed in Kiev, a move that could lead to an increase in violence. This is the latest development in what has become a bitter political standoff between the two sides, with both sides accusing each other of trying to prevent the other from forming a coalition government in order to protect the interests of their own people. Both sides have said that they are willing to cooperate in any way that is necessary to achieve the goal of reunification and to ensure a peaceful transition of power, even if that means the return of Russia to its former role as a guarantor of stability and security. As a result, Ukraine is expected to resume the process of forming an independent state, although it may take some time before this process can be completed. For now, however, it remains unclear how much time will have passed before the next election is scheduled for early next year and whether the election will go ahead as planned. What is important is that Ukraine does not have to wait for another referendum before it can decide whether or not it wants to do so. If it does, then it has to decide for itself whether to accept a referendum on independence or if the referendum should be called off. So far, so good. That is what we have seen so far. I think we are seeing a lot of progress in this regard. We have already seen the first signs that things are beginning to show that this is indeed going well. And I am very hopeful that we will see more of these developments in coming days. At the moment, though, I don't see any sign of any kind of agreement on how to proceed with this. "

The government declared the town a "safe zone" on April 14-15, 2014, in an effort to prevent the spread of terrorism. But the government of Nigeria has yet to announce a date for the end of the conflict. According to the Red Cross, the area has been hit by a number of terrorist attacks, including attacks on churches, schools and mosques. In some cases, people have been killed, while others have suffered injuries. DW's Adrian Kriesch and Umar Faruq Baba Inna, who were among the victims, reported that the army chief, Abubakar Shekau, was among those killed. "He was the only one who was able to save the lives of his wife Hauwa and their two young children," Adrian said. However, it is not clear how many people were killed or injured by the attacks. It is unclear whether the attack was carried out deliberately or whether it was an act of terror, but it appears to have taken place as a result of a combination of factors, such as the presence of Islamist militants and the lack of coordination between the military and security forces. At the same time, there were reports that a suicide bomber had been shot dead by Nigerian soldiers. This is the first time in Nigeria's history that an Islamist terrorist group has claimed responsibility for an attack on a Christian church in a town in northern Nigeria. A Nigerian military spokesman told DW in October that he had received a death threat from a terrorist organization called "Boko Haram," which claimed to be the "Islamic State" (IS) group. He also said that there was "no evidence" of any involvement from the group, which he described as an "extremist group." "I don't think there is any evidence that this is an IS attack," he said, adding that "there is no evidence to support this claim." The attack occurred on the morning of March 28. On the day of that attack, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari ordered troops to leave the country and take refuge in Chad, Cameroon, Chad and Cameroon. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, however, and it has not been confirmed whether or not the attackers were responsible for any of these attacks or if they simply acted out of fear of reprisals against Christians, Muslims and other non-Muslims. Nigeria is a country that has seen a lot of violence since the beginning of its civil war in 1991, when President Goodluck Jonathan was overthrown by Islamist groups led by then-President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hausa. Since then, many Nigerians have come to terms with the fact that their country's military has failed in its fight against the IS. Many of them have become disillusioned with its leadership and have turned to violence against them. Some have even taken to social media to express their frustration at the situation in their own country. For example, one Nigerian journalist, Lawal Emos, wrote on Twitter: "The Nigerian army has become a symbol of what is wrong with Nigeria today. We are not going to give up on our country, we will continue to fight for what we believe in." In an interview with DW, Eos said he believes that Nigeria still has a long way to go in terms of fighting terrorism and that it will have to do so in order to achieve its goal of ending the war on terror. His comments come after a series of attacks that have killed at least 40 people and wounded more than 1,000. Eus said the Nigerian armed forces have not yet been fully convinced of their ability to carry out their mission, although they have said they will be ready to take part in any military operation. They are also not convinced that they are ready for a military coup, he added, citing a recent report by an independent journalist who has written extensively about the challenges facing Nigerian society in recent years. 'We are still in shock,' he wrote, referring to a report published by Amnesty International in April 2014 in which a Nigerian soldier was shot and killed in Niger. Another Nigerian citizen, Alex Badeh, has also expressed concern over the death toll. "
,"Reference text": " #BringBackOurGirls still hopeful one year on One year ago, more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants. Parents of the missing girls told DW's correspondent in Nigeria, Adrian Kriesch, that they remain optimistic. Lawal Emos clenches his fist and kneads his fingers. He had firmly resolved not to cry when he talks about Comfort. She is a lovely girl, Emos says, always helpful and determined. Comfort is his 17-year-old daughter. A year ago she was abducted by Boko Haram from their school in the village of Chibok, northeastern Nigeria. Like other tens of thousands, Emos, his wife and their five remaining children fled to Yola, a city located 270 kilometers (167 miles) from Chibok. He has gotten thinner in recent months as his family survives on irregular donations from friends and the Red Cross. Formerly a farmer in his home town, Emos has been unable to get land in Yola. "Do you have a photo of Comfort?" I ask. And immediately the father of six breaks down in tears. Emos admits that he can't control his emotions whenever he sees his daughter's picture. He left all of them in Chibok. Opening wounds This is the third time I am in Yola since the kidnapping of the Chibok girls on the night of April 14 -15, 2014. It is also the third time while covering for DW the plight of the girls still in Boko Haram captivity. As emotional wounds of the parents are ripped open once again, tears flow, I film, and I get this bad feeling. Lawal Emos says he knows of twelve fellow parents who have died following the kidnapping. "The constant crying and thinking of their daughters killed them." Emos and his wife Hauwa sometimes find themselves thinking that it would be easier for them if they knew their daughter was dead. "I have lost my hope in politicians because they are not doing anything," Hauwa says. "Only God can still help us to find them - dead or alive. But our government, forget it." Three weeks after the abduction, the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram claimed responsibility. For six years, the Islamic sect has carried out a deadly insurgency especially in northeastern Nigeria. Initially, Boko Haram said it was fighting against the corrupt Nigerian government, but with time its objectives have become increasingly unclear. Thousands of Christians and Muslims have been killed in raids and attacks by the militants. As for the kidnapped girls, Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau said in one of his bizarre speeches, they had been sold off as slaves. Government's inconsistency An international outcry for the Chibok girls became a phenomenon with the hashtag #bringbackourgirls on Twitter. Nigeria's neighbors declared war on Boko Haram and the US sent military advisers to help locate and free the girls. On May 26, 2014, Alex Badeh, Nigeria's supreme commander of the armed forces, proclaimed that they knew the whereabouts of the girls but a rescue operation would be too dangerous. In mid-October last year, army chief Badeh went before the press again saying an armistice had been signed and that the girls will be freed. It turned out to be another lie. It took outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan and his wife three months before meeting with the parents of the girls for the first time. "He said, 'Within three weeks, you will all have your daughters back, and within three weeks, we will renovate all destroyed schools in the region,'" recalls Lawal Emos. "Three weeks passed, then several months and nothing happened." Meanwhile Boko Haram continued their attacks on villagers unabated. Will Chibok girls ever be found? Shortly before Nigerians went to the polls on March 28, the Nigerian military together with neighboring countries of Chad, Cameroon and Niger began an offensive to drive out Boko Haram from occupied territories. Many Nigerians believe the timing of the offensive in the middle of the election campaign is not entirely coincidental. "The confidence in the military is at its lowest ebb," says journalist Umar Faruq Baba Inna from Yola. The outcry on the internet for the release of the Chibok girls has gotten quieter, only a few activists are now seen protesting on Nigerian streets. Many observers believe that senior military officials have no interest in ending the insurgency because of the benefits from the massive security budget. "The incoming administration of Muhammadu Buhari has a lot to do to reassure the citizenry that we can trust government and the armed forces," Baba Inna says. Buhari's opposition APC party won a resounding victory in the northeast, where the conflict rages. Even Lawal Emos voted for the former general, who has promised to crush Boko Haram in just six months. However, Nigerian political analyst Edgar Amos doubts if Buhari will ever find the Chibok girls. "A whole year has passed and they are in the hands of heartless, brutal terrorists "

"We are very disappointed with the sentence handed down by the Euro Olympic committee," said Olympic Council of Ireland president Jurgen O'Brien, adding that it was "not appropriate" for the judge to be given the same amount of money as he had received in the previous two Olympic Games. He was also ordered to serve a two-year suspended jail term for failing to comply with an anti-doping order. Hicke, who was due to appear in court on 10 August, has been suspended for three years and is scheduled to return to the country next month for a hearing on the case. In the past, he has faced criticism over his treatment of Brazilian athletes at the Rio Olympics, where he was accused of doping during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil. On Monday, a Brazilian court sentenced him to five years' probation and ordered that he serve the remainder of his sentence. Jbh/bw (AP, AFP)The judge said he would appeal the verdict, which is expected to take place in less than two weeks. It was not immediately clear whether the sentences would be appealed or whether he will be allowed to stand trial for his role in a doping scandal that has rocked the sports world. jbh, bw, (Reuters, AP, EUOI)A judge has also been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of a criminal investigation into allegations of sexual abuse of minors. A court in Dublin has ordered the prosecution of two men who were found guilty of sexually abusing minors at a Rio hotel in 2015 and 2016, as well as two women who pleaded guilty to child pornography charges in 2016 and 2017. Both men have denied any involvement in any wrongdoing, and have been banned from competing in future Olympic games in Tokyo, Tokyo or any other city in 2020. They are also barred from running for life from the 2020 Tokyo Games after they are found to have violated the terms of their release from prison, according to a court document filed by their lawyers in August. If convicted, they could face up to 10 years behind bars if they do not cooperate fully with prosecutors, the document said. That would mean they would have to pay a fine of between 1 million and 2 million dollars for each violation. However, it would not be the first time that the court has ruled against the defendants in connection with a sex abuse scandal involving minors and underage girls. According to Reuters news agency, prosecutors have said they will seek to use the money to cover the costs of prosecuting the men, but that they have yet to make a decision on whether or not to proceed with their cases. Some Brazilian officials have also expressed concern about the possibility of jail time for those who have committed sex crimes, while others have expressed concerns over the potential for leniency in their plea deals. Many Brazilians have criticized the decision to release the women from jail, saying it is unfair and unfair to punish them for having sex with minors in order to get a fair trial. But the Brazilian government has said it will continue to fight the charges against them and will not allow them to run for re-election. At the end of last year, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff announced that she would step down from her post as president of Brazil's Olympic council. She said she had no intention of leaving Brazil and would seek a new position as a member of her country's governing body if she did not get the job back. 'I am not going to leave Brazil until I have a chance to do my job' She also said that Brazil would like to see the Olympics reinstated, although she is not sure how long that will take to happen. Brazil is the only country that wants to host the 2024 Summer Games and has not yet announced a date for its participation in that competition. "

The 71-year old can now leave the country for medical treatment. Brazilian judge Juliana Leal de Melo - who serves on a court overseeing amateur and professional sports - authorized the release of Hickey's passport upon payment of 1.5 million real ($435,000) bail. Hickey could now have medical treatment, the Rio state court system said in a statement. Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight "each and every one” of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces. Hickey, who was also the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland, was released from custody last month, but must remain in Brazil until the case is heard. "For clarity, I am not under house arrest as, like with so many things with this case, has been misreported by the media,” Hickey said in a statement on Monday. Hickey was arrested on 10 August at a luxury beachfront hotel during the games. The authorities told Reuters last week that they believe the ring had operated for around eight years and was preparing for other Olympic events such as the 2020 Tokyo Games. jbh/bw (AP, AFP) "

Berlin's German embassy in Tripoli has been the site of a major diplomatic crisis since the fall of Moammar Gadhafi in the Libyan civil war in 1990. According to a German official, the German ambassador to Libya, Said Abdulaati, was born in Berlin on April 5, 1986. In 2001, he moved to Tripoli, where he lived with his wife and two children. He worked as a receptionist for a disco club, La Belle, until 2004, when he was transferred to Berlin. His wife, Bernd, and their two young children were living with him at the time. "We had a lot of problems, but we were able to overcome them," he said. The Libyan government, which had been in power for more than 30 years, is still in a state of disarray, according to German media reports. It is not clear how long the crisis will last. There are reports that the government of Libya has spent $35 million (about 657.7 million euros) on the reconstruction of its capital, Tripoli. But it is unclear how much of that money is going to be spent on rebuilding the city, or whether it will be used to pay for the construction of new roads and bridges and other infrastructure. Some of this money has already been spent by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and the EU on reconstruction and reconstruction projects. At the same time, it has also been earmarked for other projects, such as the rebuilding of an airport in Benghazi, Libya. Germany's foreign minister Gerhard Schröder said in an interview with DW that he hoped the money would be enough to cover the costs of rebuilding Libya's infrastructure and improve the lives of millions of people living in poverty and suffering from hunger and disease. However, there is no guarantee that this will happen, because the country is in dire financial straits. For example, in 2003, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that Germany would pay the U.S. government a total of $7.5 million in aid to help rebuild Libya after the war. That amount would have been sufficient to rebuild the nation's economy and bring it back from the brink of collapse. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was then in Brussels, said it would take a long time to reach a deal with the US government on how to make the situation more stable and stable. So far, however, that has not happened. On the other hand, Washington has made a number of concessions to Libyan officials, including a pledge to give the Bedouin community a chance to live in peace. This has led to an increase in funding for Libyan charities in recent years. As a result, more and more people are coming to Germany to seek a better life for themselves and for their families, as well as for those who have lost their homes and who are in need of financial assistance. These are the kinds of things that can only be done by a government that is willing to do the hard work of building a strong, stable, prosperous and prosperous country. And, of course, this is the kind of thing that could only happen if there was an agreement between the two countries. If there wasn't, then it wouldn't have happened at all. After all, what would it have taken to build a country like Libya? That's the question that's being asked by many in Germany today. How long will it take to find a solution to this problem? "I don't know. I'm not sure yet," said Berlin-based German Foreign Affairs Minister Bernt Eastphal, adding that "it will take some time." "But I think we'll see what happens when we get there." The EU is currently working on a plan to increase the amount of aid that it can provide to African countries in order to ease the burden of reconstruction. East Germany, for instance, wants to see more aid for its poorest and most vulnerable people, while Britain is looking to boost its own aid budget by $805 million. "

Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco "La Belle" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schröder, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. "The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya," Westphal said. "We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples." Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were "excellent." Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. "The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations," said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. "This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons," Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. "We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes." This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969. "

The mayor, Jens Böhrnsen, told the Bundesrat that he was "deeply concerned" about the situation in his city. "I am deeply concerned," he said, adding that "the situation is very dangerous and I am very, very worried." "It is not only dangerous, but it is also dangerous," Mayor Thomas Röwekamp said in a statement. He added that there was a "serious danger" in the area, which has a population of 1.5 million. The city is one of Germany's largest in terms of population, with more than 2 million people living in poverty and unemployment among the top 10 percent of earners. In the aftermath of Sunday's violent protests, a number of people have been arrested and charged with crimes, including murder, attempted murder and attempted rape, according to a report by the German news agency dpa. On Wednesday morning, Mayor Bündchen, who is from the center-left Left Party, said he feared for the safety of his own people and that his government would have to deal with "a lot of problems" if it was to be able to cope with the influx of new residents. However, he did not rule out the possibility of an election next year, saying that it would be up to the voters to decide whether or not they want to run for re-election. 'We are not going to let this happen,' he added, referring to his party's stance on the issue. But he also said that if the election were to go ahead as planned, "it would not be the first time that we have seen this kind of thing happen in our city." He also pointed out that, as a member of Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), the SPD and the Greens (SPD) are the only two parties that have yet to form a coalition government in Germany, and neither of them have a majority in Bundestag. Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticized for failing to act decisively enough to prevent a repeat of last year's violence, when she refused to step down from her post as party leader. Merkel, however, has said she will continue to work closely with her party to ensure that she does not lose her grip on power. She has also called for a referendum on whether to allow the Social Democrats to take over the government, in order to protect the interests of those who have suffered the most in recent years. That referendum will be held on Tuesday, May 15. Barely a week after the polls closed, Merkel is expected to announce a new election date for her conservative party in her home state of Bavaria. If she wins, she is likely to face a tough challenge in parliament. It is unclear whether she would accept the results of her election campaign, or if she might be forced to accept a no-confidence vote in herself or her own party. There is a growing sense of unease among voters about what the future holds for Merkel and her government. Many have expressed concern about her handling of recent events, particularly the recent spate of violent attacks in southern Germany. Some have accused her of being too soft on refugees, while others say she should be more open-minded and open to dialogue with them. Others have said they are more cautious in their approach to dealing with such situations. For example, they have called on her to give up her position as chancellor. They have also criticized the way in which she has handled the refugee crisis, calling it an "unprecedented situation" that has led to an increase in deportations of asylum seekers. And they say that Merkel should not have allowed the refugees to leave the country without a clear path to citizenship. What is the point of this referendum? The question is whether it will have an impact on other German states, such as the United States, Germany or the European Union? "The referendum is an important step for Germany," Merkel said at a press conference in Berlin. "
,"Reference text": " Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens Böhrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because "after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued." Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas Röwekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. "The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition," he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. "The result showed that this strategy did not pay off," Merkel told a press conference. "

US General Philip Breedlove warned on Saturday that Russia could use its influence in the region to further destabilize the country. NATO's top commander in Europe warned that "the consequences of aggression could be catastrophic" for the alliance and its allies. "There is a danger of escalation," he told a news conference in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, adding that he was "very concerned" about the possibility of an escalation of violence. He said the US and the EU had been working closely with the Russian government to prevent a repeat of what happened in Minsk last year. The two countries have been at war since the end of World War II, when the Soviet Union collapsed and Ukraine was plunged into civil war. Russia has been accused of supporting the separatists, which it blames on Ukraine's pro-Moscow government. Moscow has denied the accusations, saying that the rebels were acting in self-defense. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the West of backing separatist rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk, accusing the NATO-led alliance of arming and training separatist groups. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a statement that Moscow had "no choice but to intervene." "We will not allow Russia to interfere in our internal affairs," Putin said, referring to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. However, he added, "we will continue to do our utmost to ensure that there is no further escalation." The Russian military said it had no intention of intervening militarily, and that it would not use force against separatists. se/ksb (AP, AFP) - type of footer The Kremlin has said that Russian forces have launched an attack on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in retaliation for Moscow's alleged support for separatist fighters. It is unclear whether Moscow will respond to the attack, or whether it will use military force, as it has done in recent days. Separately, Russian officials have said they have no reason to believe that a Russian attack would result in an increase in civilian casualties. They have not said how many people were killed or injured in Saturday's fighting, but said there was a "significant increase" in casualties from the fighting that has taken place over the past few days, according to a military source close to Moscow who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the matter with reporters. Both sides have accused each other of using chemical weapons in their fight against the separatist forces, although Moscow denies the allegations and says it does not have any evidence of such weapons being used against them. In the event of a conflict between the two sides, however, it is not clear which side is responsible for what has happened. There is currently no agreement on a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, nor has there been any agreement between Moscow and Kiev on how to resolve the issue. On Saturday, Russia accused Ukraine of violating the terms of its cease-fire agreement with Ukraine, a move Moscow said was in violation of international law. Ukraine has also accused Moscow of trying to undermine the ceasefire agreement, with Moscow accusing Kiev of failing to provide adequate security guarantees to its citizens in its war-ravaged eastern regions. Last year, Moscow claimed responsibility for more than 100,000 deaths in fighting between Ukrainian forces and rebel forces in what it called the "province-state of Donetsk." Russia denied this claim, calling the claim "baseless" and saying it did not know what was going on. According to Russian media reports, Putin had threatened to launch an offensive against Ukraine if it failed to secure the border with Russia. But the Kremlin denied any such threat and said Moscow was not ready to give up its military support to Kiev, despite the fact that Ukraine had already declared war on its eastern neighbor, Donetsk, on Sunday. Kremlin spokesman Sputnik news agency reported that Putin was also threatening to impose sanctions on Russia over its alleged involvement in Crimea's separatist conflict. European leaders have called on Moscow to step down from its post-war occupation of Ukraine after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula. "

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed "sincere hope" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. "The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story," Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. "The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers," he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared "people's republics'" in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Chinese Football Association President Michael Görner said on Monday that he was "very happy" with the decision. "I'm very happy that we're going to be able to participate in this year's tournament," he said in a statement, adding that his country was looking forward to hosting the event. Germany's foreign ministry said it was pleased with China's decision to hold the competition in its entirety, saying it would be "a great honor" for Germany to host such a prestigious competition. However, it is not clear whether the Chinese government will accept the invitation, as the country's Foreign Ministry had said earlier this week that China would not be invited to attend. In the first round, FSV Frankfurt will face off against the relegation-threatened Hamburger SV, who have been relegated to the second tier of German football since 2016. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has said that Germany will not accept any invitation from the Asian country. According to a report in Stuttgarter Zeitung, "the decision was made in accordance with international law and the rules of international football." "We are very pleased that the German government is willing to accept this decision," Gabriel said. He added that "it is an important step for our country to move forward with this tournament." The German president also expressed his "deep concern" about the situation in China, noting that there was a "serious lack of cooperation" between the two sides. Gabriel also said the club was in "great difficulty" in dealing with a number of issues, including the fact that they were unable to agree on a venue for Saturday's match. On the other hand, he added, there is "no reason why we can't have a fair and balanced competition at this time of year." German vice-president Ronny Zimmerman said his club would have to work hard to make up for lost time. mp/pfd (dpa, SID) - "It is a very difficult situation for us as a football club to deal with," said Zimmerman, whose club Hoffenheim has been playing under the same name for more than a decade. "[The club] has a lot of work to do in terms of training and training, but we are really happy to have the opportunity to train and train with them," Zimmerman added. It is unclear how long the match will last, given the high level of competition between Germany and China. At the end of last season, Germany beat China 3-0 at home and 2-1 at the World Cup in Russia, with Germany leading the table with 10 points from three games. But the league is expected to go on to win the championship in four years' time, according to FIFA's World Football Confederation (WFC), which is responsible for overseeing the development of football in Germany. Last year, German soccer's governing body FIFA announced a total of €15,000 (€17.800) for each of its member clubs, in addition to €17,800 for domestic and foreign players. That figure was up from €7,500 in 2016, when it stood at €4,600 in 2017. This year it has risen to $5,700 (around $6,300) and $8,200 (about $3,400) in 2022. What's next for China? The league's executive committee is set to meet on Friday to discuss the issue of how to improve its football infrastructure and how it can be improved. There is also the possibility of introducing a new system of rules and regulations that will allow for greater cooperation between football clubs and football associations, such as football academies and sports federations. If the regulations are not followed, however, then it could be a long time before any new rules are introduced.

The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. "To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected," the DFB said. "In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators." Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga Südwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga Südwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs – TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of €15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game – the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of "substantial evidence of further escalation," FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. "We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech," FSV Frankfurt President Michael Görner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played "within the framework of freedom of expression."

The aim is to increase the club's market share from 1.40 euros to 3,340 euros. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds The auto clubs in Germany have been in existence since 1995, when they were founded by a group of German businessmen. Since then, they have grown to become the world's largest car club, with more than 40,000 members worldwide. In 2005, the membership was increased to 5,940 euros (7,740 euros), while in 2009, it was up to 6,840 euros, or 7,930 euros for a total of 7.740 euro. "The club was founded in 1995 and has grown steadily over the years," says Jörg Schäfer, executive director of the German Auto Club (ADAC). "It has become one of Germany's leading car clubs, and we are proud to be a part of it." The club has also grown in the past five years to reach a new level of membership, which is expected to exceed the previous record set in 2005 and 2005. However, there is still a long way to go before it reaches a level where it can reach its full potential. For example, in 2000, 1,300 euros was spent on a car, while 1 1/2-euro was used to buy a house. This was followed by an increase of 2.5 percent in 2004 and a further increase in 2007. At the same time, car dealerships in other European countries have increased their investment in car-making, particularly in developing countries such as Germany and the United States, where car production is growing at a rate of 3.6 percent a year, according to the latest figures from the car industry trade association. Meanwhile, German automakers have also been investing heavily in their domestic markets, increasing their production capacity to meet demand for new cars and trucks, as well as increasing the number of cars on the road. These investments are being made in a way that will allow them to compete with the likes of Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, among others, for the most lucrative jobs in German automotive industry. They are also able to invest in new products and services, making them more environmentally friendly and more cost-effective. Read more: How German carmakers are changing the way they market their products in order to attract new customers and attract the next generation of car buyers The new car market is set to open in mid-2010, but it is not yet clear whether this will be enough to satisfy the growing demand. According to a recent report by German magazine "Auto Club" magazine, sales of new models will increase by 10 percent from 2005 to 2010, compared to last year's figures of 5.9 percent. It is also expected that the new model will have a positive impact on consumer confidence and drive-through sales.   For the first time ever, I would like to see the market grow at the expense of other car manufacturers, who are struggling to make up for lost sales and sales lost in recent years due to low interest rates and high labor costs. I think this is a good time to start thinking about what the future holds for German manufacturers and how they are going to grow their business, especially in light of recent developments in automotive technology and in particular the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (MLA) in Europe and other areas of technology that are increasingly becoming increasingly important to consumers and businesses. What is next for car makers?  "I think we will see a lot of changes in our industry as a result of this shift in consumer attitudes towards technology," said Schöfer. He added that "the market will continue to evolve as we move towards a more efficient and efficient way of doing business." He also said that he is optimistic about the prospects for future sales growth, adding that there would be "significant growth" in his industry, "in the coming years." "

In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds "

He has been working in Germany for more than a year and a half, and now he's looking forward to returning to India. "I'm very happy to be here," Rohail Aslam, the manager of Handel Kontor, said in a phone interview. The company is based in Berlin, Germany, which is home to the German-language Fachhochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft in Bhadohi, a city in Uttar-Pradesh. It's located in Bad Oeynhausen, near the border with the Czech Republic. There, he said, "we have a lot of people who want to work for us, but we don't have the resources to do that." "We have to make sure that we are able to provide jobs for our people," he added, adding that he hopes that the company will continue to expand its business. India is the only country in Western Europe that has a large migrant workforce. In India, it's the second-largest migrant labor market after Germany. And the number of migrants is growing rapidly, according to a recent study by the Friedrichshafen Institute of Technology (FSET) in Munich. But it is also the fastest growing migrant labour market in Europe, with a population of around 1.5 million people. This is a huge increase from the previous year, when the unemployment rate was around 6.6 percent, compared to just 2.7 percent for the same period last year. So far, as far as the migration is concerned, there are only a handful of migrant labourers from India who are willing to go to Germany and other Western European countries to learn German and learn the language. Many of these migrants have come from countries like Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Portugal. They have also come here as part of an exchange program between India and Germany that allows them to exchange their skills and knowledge for jobs in other countries, such as Germany or the Middle East. While many of them are still in their 20s and 30s, they still have plenty of time to grow their own businesses and make a living. For the most part, though, Indian workers are happy with their new jobs and the opportunities they have. However, one of the biggest challenges facing them is that they can't afford to travel to another country to get a job. That's why they're not allowed to come back to their home country. At the moment, India doesn't even have an official visa for migrants, so the visa is only available to those who have applied for it. Even if they do apply, that's not going to help them get the job they want, because it will only make them feel like they've been here for so long. If they apply for an Indian visa, then they will be forced to leave the country and return to China, or else they'll be deported to Spain or Portugal or Morocco. These are just a few examples of what happens when you leave your country for another foreign country, like China or China. When you return, you'll find that you're stuck in an old country where you've never been to your own country before. You'll never find a place like this again, even if you came from a country that was once a European colony. What's more, many migrants are coming here from other parts of Asia and are looking for work opportunities and opportunities in different countries. One of their main challenges is to find work in foreign countries and to establish a company that can provide employment opportunities for them. To do this, we need to develop a business model that works for people of all ethnicities, not just those of a certain ethnic background. We can only do so much if we can get some work done in one country or another. I'm not sure how long this process will take. How long will it take for India to become a successful business? It depends on what country you are from, how many jobs you have, what kind of products you can make and how much time you invest in your business and what kinds of skills you need. Germany is not a big market for German products, for example, although it does have its own manufacturing industry. German companies are also very interested in Indian products and services, especially in manufacturing and distribution. Indian companies have been making products in China for over a decade, while the rest of Europe is still very much a niche market. "

But he was eager to spend more time abroad and this time he chose Germany. His host country has thrown many challenges at him but he's been here for over five years. Small-built, smiling and very gentle, Rohail explains why he stayed. DW-WORLD: Why did you choose Germany in the first place? Rohail Aslam: I already knew a little bit of German, and I joined the Goethe Institute (Max Mueller Bhavan) in New Delhi to fine-tune it. After almost a year in Delhi, I finally landed in Germany to do an MBA at the ‘Fachhochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft’ in Berlin. What made you stay for so long? It was pretty much understood that after I had graduated, I would stay back for a while to gather some knowledge of the country, the country’s business structure and the working culture. I also had the intention of doing an internship here and getting a job to gain some experience here. My family has a carpet manufacturing company back in India. My parents wanted to expand it and start exporting abroad. So, while I was studying, they set up a company in Bad Oeynhausen in north-west Germany. We've been actively exporting rugs to Germany, Western Europe and the US for four years. What could be better than giving my knowledge and expertise to my parents and to their company instead of offering those services to someone else? Does the manufacturing process also take place in Germany? No, everything happens in India -- in Bhadohi in Uttar-Pradesh, which is a renowned carpet-belt -- and the services are much cheaper there. Once the product is completed, it's exported to Germany in huge quantities. Who designs the rugs? Designing is a two-way process. Either we pick our own designs and work on them -- we have two specialised designers who work for us. But if clients come to us with certain designs, colours and patterns then we make the rugs according to their requirements. Where is your company based? We have two companies which are both owned by my mother. The parent company is the manufacturing unit based in India -- called ‘Rohail Teppich Export’ - and the daughter company exports from Germany and is called ‘Handel Kontor’. So we sit here in Germany communicating with our clients, showing them our new products, introducing new colours and designs, inviting them to visit our showroom in Germany in case they cannot visit India. Do your carpets have a lot of Indian colours or designs? Well, I would not exactly classify them as Indian designs or colours. It's more about the trend of the market -- this could be anything. If it's called ‘Indian’, then it is. But the only justification for calling our carpets Indian is that they are manufactured in India. Unless, of course, somebody wants a carpet which has an Indian palace in its design. Otherwise, we mostly have modern and abstract designs -- for example, a bunch of boxes and dices. What is the market in Germany like compared to that of other European countries or the United States? The market is, of course, better in the comparatively colder countries. Having said that, conditions in Spain and in Portugal have actually been booming in the last decade or so. But overall the market is slow at the moment because the entire purchasing and selling pattern has changed. For example, 15 or 20 years ago a carpet or rug was almost a status symbol -- it was valuable. Now rugs are available everywhere. Not only that, earlier a rug meant handmade work and precision work by hand. But now you have machines, even robots, making rugs. Are your carpets also machine-made? The rugs we have are entirely hand-made. We have no machine work anywhere in our enterprise -- we don't have a production plant as such. The entire work process, from ‘start’ to ‘finish’, of a rug is entirely hand-made. Was it very difficult to start up a company in Germany? In fact no. Some might say it was as easy as child-play -- there were very little bureaucracy or paper-work. The whole company had been set up within a couple of hours. So, the set-up procedure is simple. But how easy is it to keep the business going? Well, that's the challenge. Because here there are not only other Indians who have stalls, shops or companies, there are also Persians, Turks, Moroccans, Germans, and English people. So there is a lot of competition. And the guarantee for success is dependent on the amount of effort and, more importantly, on market support. How do you cope with this " 

},{"Generated text": " Barack Obama to visit Spain at Guantanamo Bay US President Barack Obama is expected to meet with Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba in Madrid on Tuesday. The two men are scheduled to hold talks at the US naval base in Cuba. Spain is set to host a US delegation to Cuba for the first time since the end of the war in Sept. 11, 2001. Obama's visit to Spain will be accompanied by a visit by Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, who is due to be sworn in on January 22, 2010. In a statement, Obama said he would be visiting Spain as part of his "long-term plan" to improve relations between the two countries. "We are going to continue to work closely with the Cuban government to ensure that we have the best possible relationship with Cuba," he said, adding that he was "deeply concerned about the situation in Spain." Obama will also hold a bilateral meeting with Cuban President Nicolas Sarkozy on Wednesday to discuss the future of Spain's military presence in Guantanamo, which is currently under construction in the Spanish city of Madrid. Spanish officials have said that they would like to see an agreement between Cuba and Spain on the terms of an end to the detention of US troops stationed there, as well as on a number of other issues, such as terrorism and the right to self-determination. On the day Obama visited Spain, he also met with European leaders and foreign ministers. During the visit, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former US ambassador to Washington, told reporters that Obama would visit Madrid in January 2010 to "discuss the issues that have been pressing on him since he left the White House." The visit came a day after Spanish President George W. Bush announced that Spain would open its embassy in Havana to US officials. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer The US president has been accused of using torture as a weapon of mass destruction in order to justify his decision to open the Guantanamo detention center. He has denied any involvement in any attacks on US personnel, saying he had no knowledge of what was going on. A US official told the Associated Press in an interview that the president had "no knowledge" of Guantanamo's existence, but that it was a "matter of time" before the decision was made. It was not immediately clear whether Obama intended to attend the meeting, or whether he wanted to talk to Spanish authorities directly about his plans to close the prison. According to a Spanish official, there was no discussion of whether or not Obama was willing to go to Guantanamo. However, the official did say that there were discussions about a possible return to normal relations with Spain after the September 11 attacks, and that a decision had been made to do so in a way that would allow the transfer of American troops to other countries, including the United States. That is not to say Obama did not have a strong interest in opening up the facility, however. If he did, it would not only be a symbolic gesture but also a gesture of respect for Spanish sovereignty. After all, Spain has long been the world's most powerful democracy, with more than 1.5 million people living in exile than any other country on earth, according to figures compiled by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). In January, President Obama signed an executive order setting up a special commission to investigate the use of torture and other forms of violence against the Palestinian population. At the same time, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the commission would look into the possibility that torture could be used as an instrument of international terrorism. But the Obama administration has not yet made any decision on how to handle the issue, despite the fact that many European countries have expressed concern over the prospect of opening their embassies there. And while Obama has made it clear that his administration is committed to ending torture, many of those who have committed crimes against humanity will not be able to participate in that process. So far, so good, in fact, is the administration's approach to dealing with this issue. There is no indication that any of these issues are being addressed by Obama, even if they are discussed openly in public. "

The move shows Madrid's support of US efforts to close the controversial prison. Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian. The new arrival will be able to work and move around Spain as he wishes, but will not be able to leave the country. "He is a Palestinian, he has already arrived in our country. We do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally," he told a news conference. Spain urges others to 'do the utmost' Spain's decision to take five Guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help US President Barack Obama with his plans to shut down the jail. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries "to do their utmost" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet. Some 200 detainees remain there, but finding places to take in the prisoners - even the dozens already cleared for release - has proved controversial. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer " 

},{"Generated text": " Great Britain's Brexit plans are set to be unveiled in the House of Commons The British government is preparing to unveil its plans for the country's exit from the European Union next week. The plan is to leave the bloc by the end of the year. British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will announce the details of her plans within the next few days. "We are going to do everything in our power to make sure that we have the best possible outcome for our country," May said in a speech to parliament on Wednesday. She also said that she would be open to talks with the EU's 27 member states, including the US, US and EU. However, she said, "we are not ready to give up on the idea of a free and open Europe," adding that the UK would not be able to negotiate its own exit without a deal with Brussels. 'Brexit is not an easy thing to achieve,' May added. Brexiteers and Remainers have been calling for a "hard Brexit" for some time now, but May's speech came as a surprise to the British parliament, which voted in favor of an orderly withdrawal of EU membership. But it was not enough to convince the majority of British lawmakers that a hard Brexit was the only way to get Britain back into the single market. It was also the first time a British prime minister had to explain to a parliamentary majority why she didn't want to go through with her plan. Brexit is a big deal for Britain, and it's not just about the economy. There are also a number of other issues, such as Brexit's impact on jobs and the environment, as well as the fact that it will affect the lives of millions of people who depend on their country for their livelihoods. That's a huge problem for many British politicians, especially those who are pro-European and who want a smooth transition to an EU that is more open and friendly to them than the rest of us. This is something that can only be solved through negotiation and negotiation. And it can't be done through negotiations, because it doesn't work that way. In the past, there has been a lot of talk about how much Britain would have to pay if it wanted to stay in Europe. Now, it seems to me that there is no way around that. I don't think there will be any negotiation at all. We are talking about a very difficult transition period, a period in which the government has to decide what kind of policies it wants to implement and how long it plans to stick to. At the same time, I think it is important to have a clear vision of what the future of Britain will look like in terms of its relationship with Europe and its role in shaping its future. So far, that has not been the case. What is clear is that Britain is prepared to accept the terms and conditions of any deal it has agreed to with EU leaders. If it does not, then we will have no choice but to move forward with our plans. As a result of this, we can expect to see more and more negotiations between EU and British governments in coming weeks and months. For the moment, the two sides are in agreement on how to proceed with negotiations. One of them is the process of negotiating a new trade deal between Britain and Europe, while the other is still in its early stages. Both sides have said they are willing to take a chance on negotiations and that they will work together to reach a final agreement. They have also agreed on a timetable for when the talks will take place. After all, if the negotiations can be concluded, what will happen to Britain after Brexit? "I think we'll see what happens," said Birgit Maass, parliamentary affairs director at the Department of International Trade and Industry (DITI). "But I'm not sure we're ready for that yet," she added, pointing out that negotiations are still going on in Brussels and Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, EU President Donald Trump has called for an end to negotiations with Britain over the issue of Brexit. He said he was "very optimistic" that "a deal could be reached in time." But he added that he did not expect a breakthrough in negotiations until after the referendum. "
,"Reference text": " Opinion: A decision against heart and mind The House of Commons has passed the Brexit bill - despite most parliamentarians being against it. But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as "a catastrophe." No vote "against the will of the people." Of course there are "Brexiteers" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the "Little Europeans." But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go "against the will of the people." Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say?

This article is part of a series of articles on the topic of no detox water, which will be published in a forthcoming issue of the journal "No Detoxin Water."  The article will also be available in print, online, and in the print edition of "The New York Times" and the "New Yorker" magazine. Read more about the article here. Klaus and his wife, Klaus, have been living in Germany for more than 30 years. They have two children and two grandchildren. The first is Klaus' daughter, who was born in 1989. She is now in her mid-20s and works as a waitress at a restaurant in Berlin. Her husband works for the restaurant chain, where she works part-time as an administrative assistant. He is also a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Stuttgart. "I have always been fascinated by the idea of drinking water from rivers, lakes and rivers. I have never seen anything like it before," Klaus said, adding that he had never heard of such a thing before. In his opinion, it would be a waste of time and money to waste water on rivers and lakes. This is not the case at all. There is no such thing as clean water and there are no chemicals in water that can be used to clean up rivers or lakes, but there is always the possibility that the water may be contaminated with bacteria or other harmful substances, such as mercury, arsenic, chromium, lead, or lead. These are all possibilities that could be explored and explored in an effort to find out what exactly is going on with the current water supply. What is the best way to do this? Well, first of all, you have to be willing to pay a lot of money for it. That's why you can't just go to the store and buy a few bottles of water for yourself. You can also buy some bottled water if you want to save money. But that's not going to solve the problem at hand. It will only lead to more problems for you and your family. And it will not solve your problems, because you are not responsible for your own health and well-being. So, what do you do to make sure that you don't contaminate your environment with harmful chemicals? I think it's a good idea to try and find a solution that will help you live a healthier and happier life, not just a more environmentally friendly life. We'll see how it goes from here on out, as Klaus says, "It's all about making sure you're doing the right thing." Klaus explains that this is one of his main goals: to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals that are released into the environment and to improve the quality of life of those who live there. To do that, he recommends that people avoid toxic substances like mercury and arsenic in order to protect themselves and their families from exposure to toxins. However, that doesn't mean that they should be allowed to continue to drink the same water as they do now, since they have already done so much damage to their homes and businesses. Therefore, they must be careful not to poison themselves with poisonous substances that may harm their health or their livelihoods, especially if they are toxic to humans. For example, mercury is poisonous to human beings and can cause cancer, so it should not be considered toxic in any way, even if it is harmful to people's health, particularly to those with a high risk of death or serious illness, like cancer. Or it could just be the result of toxins released from contaminated water sources that kill people and cause them to die, say Klaus. Which is why I'm not sure what the solution is for this. Why is it so important to me that I can do something about it? Because I know that if I do it, I'll be doing it for a long time to get rid of some toxins that might harm my health. Then I will do my best to remove toxins from my environment. "

In Lebanon, for example, it is not a Middle Eastern country. It is a country that is dominated by Islamists. There are a lot of Arab countries, but Lebanon is one of them. The country has a long history of being a center of conflict between the West and its Arab neighbors. During the first half of the 20th century, Lebanon was the only Arab country in the world to have a democratic political system. But in 2004 and 2005, the country experienced a wave of civil unrest, which led to the formation of a new political party, called the Democratic Left Movement (DHKM), which later became the Lebanese Arab Socialist Party (LSPM). In 2004, al-Jazeera reported on the "Arab Spring" in Beirut, saying that it was "the first time in Lebanon that a major political movement had been founded." In 2009, a group of radical Islamists, led by Salafis, seized control of Lebanon's parliament and seized the presidency of President Michel Aoun, who was elected to parliament in 2005. Majed was among the leaders of this group. He was also a lecturer at the American University, where he studied political science. "It was very difficult for me to understand what was going on," he told Deutsche Welle, adding that he had no idea what he was talking about. At the same time, he said, "I don't know what is going to happen next. I'm not sure what will happen after that." The Arab-French media is divided on this issue, with the Western media focusing on Egypt, Tunisia, Egypt and Lebanon as well as the Muslim Brotherhood. On the other hand, many of these countries have their own political and religious institutions, such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the so-called "Islamic State" (IS) in Syria and Syria. Many of those institutions have been shut down in recent years, due to a lack of funding from the United States, Europe and other Western countries. That is why the Internet has become so popular in Europe, especially in countries like Tunisia and Tunisia. As a result, people are increasingly turning to social media to find out what's happening in their country, and how the situation is affecting their lives. This is especially true in places like Lebanon where there are so many radical Islamist groups. You can find them on Youtube and Youtube. And you can see them all over the internet. They are not just talking to each other, they are also communicating with you on their social networks. These are the kinds of things that are important to you. If you want to communicate with your friends and family, you have to talk to them through the phone, on your phone or on a social network, or you will be met with a barrage of negative comments. Some people have even resorted to violence. One of my friends in Alexandria, Khalid Said, was killed in an attack on his car last week. His car was hit by a car and he suffered serious head injuries. Another man was seriously injured when he tried to run away from a police station. Both men were taken to hospital and later died of their injuries, according to eyewitnesses. Interview: Jefferson Chase Editor: Rob Mudge "The Internet is an important part of our daily lives, because it gives us an opportunity to express ourselves in a way that we have never been able to do before." It's also important for us to keep in touch with our fellow citizens in our own countries and to get a sense of how things are going. We need to make sure we are doing the right thing, so we can get the message out to our friends, our neighbors and our enemies. What do you think about this? I think it's a good question to ask yourself: Is it a question of whether or not we should be doing something about it? Is this something that can be done? If so, how can we do that? And if not, what kind of message do we send to people who are radicalized by the media?" The question is: How can you send a message to someone who is radical and who doesn't share your views? The answer is simple: "We can't send messages to those who aren't radical," said the author of an article for the German-language newspaper "Al-Arabiya." He added that "we can only do this if we understand that the people in this country are very radical." But he also pointed out that in order to reach a wider audience, one has to go through a process of reconciliation and reconciliation with one another. For him, reconciliation is essential. Relationships with other countries are essential to achieving that goal. "
,"Reference text": " 'The term Islamist doesn't mean anything anymore' Not since 1989 has a whole region undergone democratic revolution, but what are the common denominators in the Arab Spring? DW asked Lebanese lecturer and activist Ziad Majed, and he gave some surprising answers. Ziad Majed is a lecturer in political science at the American University in Paris. In 2004, he co-founded the Democratic Left Movement and participated in the Lebanese uprising of 2005 against the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. In 2009 he joined the Beirut Spring Forum. Deutsche Welle: We hear a lot about the relatively young age of populations in the countries that have overthrown rulers this year. But your take on that is somewhat different, isn't it? Ziad Majed: The demographic boom that we had in the past was over a few years ago, but the product of this boom is there, and it was young people taking to the streets now. However, the birth rate of this generation is much lower than that of its parents. That means at the age of 25 or 26, when their parents had two or three or four children, they don't have any kids. That makes them more capable of being mobilized. In addition, the fact that the age of marriage, whether for economic reasons or changing values, is becoming higher allowed them to take to the streets. This explains why the revolutions happened now and not five or 10 years ago. But youth still plays a role. You have to realize that people were simply extremely tired of seeing the same old faces in power who ruled when their parents were young. What I could also add is urbanization. That means territorial and social continuity. Young people are no longer isolated in small villages or small towns. The role of global media feeds into that trend, doesn't it? The first thing is satellite media. Anywhere you go in the Arab world, you'll see small dishes or even illegal satellite TV receptors. So direct governmental censorship and control of the media is no longer an issue. Everyone goes to al-Jazeera or al-Arabiya or even Arabophone European stations. Then, Internet penetration is becoming much higher. People can meet in cyber-cafés and discuss what they read. In Egypt, for instance. Khalid Said was a young guy in Alexandria who owned a cyber-café. The police were trying to force him to pay bribes and he refused. He even took pictures with his mobile phone of policemen beating someone. So they kidnapped him, and he was beaten and killed. The anger following his death led to the creation of a facebook page, which was one of the most important sites at the beginning of the revolution. In Syria, what was most important was that every citizen became a reporter. Independent, international media aren't allowed. So the only way for people to cover what's happening is by making mobile-phone images and uploading them to Youtube so the world can witness what's going on. A moderate Islamist party just took the most votes in elections in Tunisia, and the Muslim Brotherhood may emerge as the strongest party in next month's vote in Egypt. How does that square with democracy? The term "Islamist" doesn't mean anything anymore. The word arose in the 1980s and 90s to describe the rise of political Islam. Today, there's a whole sprectrum of groups that can be described as Islamist from the Wahabis to the Salafis, the Muslim Brotherhood to Hezbollah and Hamas. All these groups are different and don't agree on a single version of the sharia. The West should understand that under repressive regimes mosques were places of refuge, and that there's a tendency after the fall of a regime to vote for groups representing the victims of that regime. So it's logical that there should be some Islamist parties doing well. But that doesn't mean the same thing it did in the 1980s and 90s, when the movements concentrated on changing regimes by violence or force. For the first time, Islamist movements have achieved power through elections, and that will change them, making them part of the political game. They may win now. But if they don't deliver on problems like unemployment, why would anyone vote for them again? But won't they try to turn back the clock in a lot of ways? They might be very conservative in their mindset, but they cannot impose what they consider to be an Islamization of society. They are not the strongest part of the democratic movement, only the most organized. I'm not scared because I think the Arab Spring is irreversible. People have discovered the power of the street and of mobilization. So if the "Islamists" try to impose something on society, what's stopping people from going back out on the street and saying "We're not happy with this?" And what can Europe and the West in general do to help ensure that the democratic promise of the Arab Spring becomes a reality? Four things. We need investment that's decentralized so as to bring prosperity to neglected regions and that's guided by a principle of corporate responsibility. We need observers who monitor progress and "

It's the first museum in the world to explore the phenomenon of Satan. The museum is located on the northern coast of England and has a collection of artifacts from the 1780s and 18th century. There are also a number of paintings, sculptures and sculptures, as well as an exhibition of some of Manfred's works. One of his most famous works is "The Philosopher's Stone," which he discovered while visiting England in 1799. He was fascinated by the idea of an ocean that could be used as a laboratory for scientific research. "It's a beautiful place," he said, adding that it was "a place to study the mysteries of nature and the nature of man." "I think it's an interesting place for us to look at the history of mankind," said the museum director, Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, who was born in 1817 in Cuxhaven, near the German city of Göttingen. In 1793, he became a professor of physics and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on thermodynamics. His work was published in scientific journals, and he was given the title of "Doctor of Science" by a German physician. After the war, the Germans moved to Germany, where they settled in Heiligendamm, a small town about 100 kilometers (75 miles) north of Cologne. During this time, they were able to travel by ship, which they called the "Chalk Cliffs on Rügen," or "Siberian Sea." They also had the opportunity to visit the Baltic Sea in July and August, when they visited the city. They were invited to stay for a few days, but were not allowed to leave until the end of September. This was the last time they would see the sea. Since then, there have been many attempts to find a new location for their museum, including a visit to a nearby hospital and a tour of a shipwrecked manor house. At the beginning of this century, German scientists discovered that the ocean was not as deep as it once was, so they decided to take a trip to see if they could get a better view of it. That's how they found their new home, in what was then known as "Heiligenberg" in Germany. But it wasn't until 1818 that they began to realize that there was a need for an island to be explored by Europeans. So they set out on a quest to discover what they wanted to do with their lives. And they did find it in their own time. For many years, this quest led them to seek out a place in Europe. Eventually, however, it led to an idea that Europe was becoming more and more dependent on European medicine and medicine. As a result, many Europeans came to believe that medicine was necessary for the survival of human beings. These ideas were developed by German physicians and pharmacists who were trained in medicine to treat diseases and diseases, such as measles and typhoid. By the mid-1800s, Germany was beginning to develop a medical system for treating people suffering from these diseases. According to German historian Caspar David Friedrich, medical treatments for men's diseases were becoming increasingly common, especially among the young people of today. When the disease was first discovered, doctors began treating the patients with antibiotics and other treatments. Many of these treatments were given to patients in hospitals and clinics. Some of them were treated with the same treatment as those who had been treated in a hospital. Nowadays, patients are treated by doctors and specialists. A new museum has been opened in Hamburg in September to show the extent to which the treatment of patients has improved over the past few years. Last year, more than 1,000 patients were admitted to Hamburg's medical clinic. Most of those patients had already been discharged by July, according to Friedrich. However, some were discharged in August and some had to wait until August to receive their treatment. "
,"Reference text": " A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. "Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot," says Manfred Bätje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was "stepping into the unknown". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of Göttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay "Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. "For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers," Bätje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on Rügen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. "The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism," soliloquizes museum director Bätje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. "It wasn't comfortable," explains Bätje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. "Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out'," quips archivist Manfred Bätje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. "Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape," Bätje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. Bätje: "People were still cultivating their genteel pallors." Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in " 

},{"Generated text": " Spiegel Affair: What is Spiegel? Spiegel is one of the most important German media outlets. It's the only one in the country that has ever published a satirical magazine, Spiegel. The magazine has become a symbol of freedom and democracy in Germany. In October, 1962, the Bundeswehr published the first edition of Spiegel, which was published by the German Federation of Journalists (DFG). It was the last edition to be published before the end of World War II, when the magazine was handed over to the defense minister Konrad Adenauer. Since then, it has been a regular feature of Germany's public broadcaster, Deutsche Welle. But Spiegel has also become an important symbol for freedom of expression in a country where freedom is a fundamental human right. Spiegel was first published in October 1962 by Nikolas Brender, a German journalist who was killed in an air raid in Hesse. After the war, Germany became a member of NATO, and after the fall of communism, there was a lot of pressure on the government to do more to protect the rights of journalists, especially those who worked for the armed forces. That pressure, however, was not enough to stop Spiegel from publishing more and more satirical articles, such as the one by Dirk C. Fleck. "We have to make sure that Spiegel does not continue to publish the same kind of material as it did before," said Spiegel editor Michael Konken, who has written a book about the Spiegel affair. He added that it was important for Spiegel to have the right to print its own stories, since the publication of such articles would be a threat to national security and the rule of law. However, he also pointed out that there is no such thing as a free press in this country, even if there are a few exceptions to that rule. There are exceptions, of course, but there have been exceptions. For example, if a magazine published an article that was critical of Adolf Hitler, then it would not be considered a "free press" at all. This is not the case in which Spiegel published its first article in 1962. And it's not just Spiegel that is being criticized for its coverage of Hitler's rise to power in West Germany, as well as its use of Nazi-era propaganda. Germany has a long history of censorship and censorship, with the exception of one case where a journalist was arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison for publishing a Nazi propaganda piece. At the time of his arrest, German Chancellor Bodo Hombach was in exile in Sweden, where he was convicted of spying on German citizens. During his time in jail, Strauss was also accused of being a spy and of having links to Nazi sympathizers. Strauss had a reputation for being an "anti-Semite." He was later pardoned for his role in exposing the crimes committed by Nazi collaborators during the Cold War. Now he's back at it again, this time for a second time. According to Axel Springer's Frank Schirmacher, director of international affairs at the think tank Reporters without Borders (ROSS), the situation is even worse in other countries, including Sweden and Denmark. As a result of Strauss' decision to release the book, many German journalists have become disillusioned with their country and are increasingly turning to social media in search of a new source of information. On the other hand, some of them have come out in favor of free speech. Some have even gone so far as to say that they are willing to give up their positions in order to get a chance to speak out against the regime's policies. Others say they don't want to risk losing their jobs or their livelihoods. They say the media should be allowed to express themselves freely, without fear of reprisals from the public and private sectors. So far, though, they have not been able to find a way out of this situation. Even the conservative Social Democrat party (SPD) has expressed its concern about Strauss's treatment of reporters, saying that he is "not going to let this happen again." "I think it is very important that we have an open and transparent society where journalists can express their views," he said, adding that the issue of media freedom was "very important" for Germany and that journalists should have access to information and information that could be shared with others.

,"Reference text": " Taking stock of press freedom in Germany Fifty years ago, the offices of "Spiegel" magazine were searched and leading journalists arrested as a result of political pressure. Press freedom eventually prevailed. Today too the media's independence is under threat. What happened in October, 1962, had a lasting effect on the relationship between politicians, the judiciary and journalists in Germany. Spiegel news magazine had published an article critical of Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr. The German army, it said, was only "prepared for defense to a limited extent", adding it would certainly have to employ nuclear missiles to counter attacks. That was the author's conclusion following an evaluation of a NATO maneuver. Leading politicians - first and foremost Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss - accused the magazine of treason. A constitutional lawyer filed charges against the editorial office, arrest warrants were issued for the author and the chief editor. The latter remained in custody for more than 100 days. The Spiegel editorial department was shut down for weeks. There was a public outcry against the state's handling of the journalists, even protest from members of the coalition government. In the end, Defense Minister Strauss was forced to resign after his considerable participation in the reprisals against the news magazine became evident. Germany's Federal Court of Justice also ruled there was no proof of treason. What became known as the Spiegel Affair still touches issues that are highly relevant even today. Is a democratic state allowed to reprimand critical reporters? And how freely can the German media report on politics? Press freedom today "Such featherbrained attempts by politics to influence the press are today no longer possible," Bodo Hombach, former Social Democrat and director of WAZ media group, told Deutsche Welle. The head of the German Federation of Journalists (DJV), Michael Konken agrees. "We have a critical media with quality publications and broadcasters who bring such problems to the public." At the same time, Konken has to admit that Reporters without Borders has in the past years ranked Germany only in places 17 to 19 in its press freedom index. The top places where occupied by the Scandinavian countries. This, Konken said, pointed to problems in Germany. And indeed, there have been examples confirming that in the recent past. Politics has grip on public broadcasters The "Brender case" is often viewed as an example of a blow to freedom of the press. Nikolas Brender was editor-in-chief of Germany's public broadcaster ZDF. As he was an independently minded journalist who would not refrain from saying what he thought, he was not always popular with politicians. It was first and foremost Roland Koch, premier of the state of Hesse at the time, who opposed renewing Brender's contract - and Bender lost his job. How was this possible? All public broadcasters are officially controlled by their supervisory and administrative boards. After the experience of government controlled media under the Nazis, broadcasters in post-war West Germany were supposed to be democratically controlled. The boards are made up of a cross-section of society, including politicians from all major parties. In the case of ZDF when Brender was editor in chief, the board was dominated by conservative politicians. And that's what stacked the odds against Bender when it came to extending his contract. Powerless The way in which Brender was treated by the politicians on the board caused an uproar across the entire media landscape in Germany. Even representatives of the conservative media thought that a line had been crossed. "An act of unbelievable high-handedness" of those responsible, says Mathias Döpfner, who is at the helm of the conservative Axel Springer publishing house. "A dangerous interference with the DNA of a broadcaster," criticized Frank Schirmacher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily. But, again and again, there have been attempts - mostly by politicial leaders - to interfere with the internal affairs of a broadcaster; a claim confirmed by Hartmann von der Tann, former coordinator for politics with Germany's other big public broadcaster, ARD. Print media also affected Newspapers in Germany experience limits to press freedom for different reasons. Dirk C. Fleck, for his book "The Fourth Power," spoke to 25 leading journalists and editors-in-chief about how independent they are. There's not a lot of room, he says. Speaking to DW, the author described the sobering answers he got and how almost all of the journalists describe the same vicious circle. It began with the boom of the Internet. More and more people got their news from the Web; in particular, young people who are important for advertising. Many companies therefore shifted their advertising budgets to focus on the Internet. German publishers responded by setting up online newsrooms to get some of the money going into online ads. But the free content offered online has not generated enough revenue through advertising. The print media has failed to capitalize on the online market. With the same budget, publishers have since tried to sustain both their print and online editions. As a result, editorial "

Obama is expected to meet with military leaders in Washington, D.C. The president is scheduled to speak at a joint press conference with Vice President Joe Biden at Joint Base Andrews (JB Andrews). The two-day visit is the first official visit by US President Obama to the base since he was sworn in as commander of US forces in Afghanistan in January. In a statement, Obama said the visit was "a great opportunity for the president to make a positive impact on the lives of our troops and our allies." Obama also said he would visit the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility at Camp Springs, Ohio, where he has been stationed since leaving the White House in 2009. "I'm very proud of the work that we've done here," he said, adding that he hoped to see the facility open by the end of this year. He also called for an end to military spending on military personnel, saying it was a "disgrace" for US taxpayers to not be able to afford the cost of living in a country where the military spends so much of its time and resources on its own. A spokesman for Obama told reporters, "The president will be meeting with the leaders of both parties at 9 am local time (9 am ET) to discuss the matter." The visit comes as the Obama administration prepares to hold a special summit with leaders from both major US political parties in Ohio and Ohio later this week. Read more: Obama, Biden and Biden to attend military summit in DC Obama's visit to Maryland is set to take place at the same time as his trip to Washington. During the meeting, the two leaders will also hold talks on a number of issues, including the use of drones in combat, as well as how to combat terrorism and the threat of terrorism. US officials have said they expect the summit to go ahead as planned, but they have yet to say whether they will attend the event. Biden, who is visiting from Ohio for a medical conference, is due to arrive at Andrews later Thursday morning. According to a US official, there are no plans to fly the plane. However, it is believed that the aircraft will fly over the area and take part in an exercise to test the effectiveness of air defense systems. Air Force One is currently being used for training exercises in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. It is also expected that a plane will land in Baltimore on Friday morning and then take off on Saturday evening. There is no word yet on when the flight will depart for Washington or whether it will leave for Ohio.  Obama has already met with officials from the Pentagon, which has said that it would be up to him to decide whether or not he wants to travel to DC for medical treatment. On Thursday, however, he did not rule out the possibility of a visit from Biden or Biden. When asked about the travel ban, a spokesperson for Biden said: "We are not aware of any restrictions on travel. We are aware that there is a ban on commercial flights from certain countries."  The US government has not yet decided whether the ban will apply to all military aircraft flying over US territory. But, if it does, then the decision will have to be made in accordance with US law, according to US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. This is an important step for both the administration and Congress. If Obama does not sign the order, military officials say he will make it clear that they do not want to delay the deployment of aircraft to other US bases. They say the move is necessary to ensure that US troops are safe and secure in their areas of duty and to avoid any potential conflict with other countries. As a matter of fact, this is not a policy that is being taken into consideration by any US president. What is important is that all US citizens have access to medical care. That is why we have the highest level of respect and respect for our country's military, and we are committed to doing everything we can to protect our nation's interests.

The Pakistani medical expert Hasan Askari Rizvi was among those killed when a gunman opened fire on his hospital bed in Pakistan's Punjab province on Monday night. According to a report in Deutsche Welle, the attacker was a Punjabi-speaking doctor who was shot and killed by a Pakistani police officer. "He was the first person to be shot in the head by the Taliban," Hasan said, adding that he was not aware of the incident at the Jinnah Hospital, where the gunman was being treated. He said he had no idea what was going on until he heard the gunfire and saw the doctor's body lying on the floor of a room in front of him. It was unclear how many people were injured, but it is believed that at least 30 to 40 people had been shot, according to the report, which also said that a number of civilians had also been injured. In a statement issued on Friday evening, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the attack was "an act of revenge for the death of an innocent Pakistani citizen." "The Pakistani government has made it clear that it will not tolerate this kind of violence," Sharif added. Pakistani doctors have been treating the injured in hospital since March, when they discovered that they were suffering from severe head injuries from a bullet wound sustained in an attack on a medical facility in Karachi. Doctors have said they will treat the wounded as if they had just been treated at a hospital, and that the bullet wounds were not life-threatening. However, there is still a long way to go before they can be treated as a serious case of serious head injury, said Hasan, who works for a private health insurance company in Punjab. Pakistan is currently facing a series of terror attacks, including one in which a suicide bomber was killed. Last month, Pakistan declared a state of emergency over the disputed Kashmir region of Pakistan, saying it would not allow "terrorists" to enter the country. Disha Uppal, a political expert and journalist from the German-language daily DeWelle (DFW), said there were fears that Pakistan would be forced to close its border with India. She added that there was also a fear of reprisals against Pakistani Muslims, as well as the possibility of more attacks on Pakistani civilians. “There is a lot of fear,” she said. This fear has led to an increase in suicide attacks and a rise in sectarian violence, especially among Sunni Muslims. But the fear is not over yet, she added, because there are still many Shias who are not willing to give up their religion to join the militant group. There is also fear that this fear will spread to other religious groups, such as Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. As a result, many of these groups have turned to Islam in order to fight for their own survival. For example, one of them, Ahmadi, has become a prominent figure in Pakistani politics, while the other, Shiites, have become increasingly intolerant of Islam. A recent spate of attacks has seen a surge in violence in recent months, with several people being killed and hundreds of people wounded. At the end of March alone, more than 1,000 people have died in attacks across Pakistan. Many of those attacks were carried out by suicide bombers, although the number is far higher than in any other year. These attacks have caused widespread panic among the Muslim community, leading to fears of further attacks. Experts say that if the violence continues, it could lead to even more deaths. What is happening now is that more people are going to come to Pakistan to seek refuge. If the situation continues to deteriorate, then the government will have to step up its efforts to bring about a return to normalcy. That is why we are calling for an end to violence against the minority community. We want to make sure that no one is left behind, so that we can continue to live in peace and stability. And that is what we will do if we have the opportunity to do that. So far, this has not been the case. "
,"Reference text": " Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the "Punjabi Taliban"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the "Punjabi Taliban". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas "

The Catalan club announced on Friday that it had appointed Vilanca as its new coach in November 2011, replacing Pep Guardiola, who was fired by the Catalan side in July. "Totti is a man of the people," Guardiola said in a statement, adding that he was "deeply disappointed" with the job he had been doing at the Nou Camp club. He was replaced by former Bayern boss Vilas in the summer of 2011 after Guardiola was sacked by Barcelona for failing to deliver on his promise to improve the team's fortunes. In July, Guardiola took over as Barcelona's manager, but the Spaniard was forced to step down after just one season in charge. Guardiola has since returned to his former club, Barcelona, and is expected to take over the reins at a time when the Catalans are in dire need of a new manager. pfd/lw (AFP, news agency, Reuters)- "We are not going to let you down," he said. - "I will not allow you to get down and dirty with me. I will never do that again." - Guardiola's successor - Vilassa was also named the head of Bayern's youth academy, where he spent two seasons as a player and coach, before moving to Barcelona in late 2011.- 'We have a lot of work to do' - The coach said he would be "very happy" to be given the opportunity to lead his club to the next level of competition, which will be played at Camp Nou next month. Barcelona have already qualified for next season's Champions League after beating Real Madrid 2-0 in their opening match. However, they will have to wait until the end of July to make sure they are ready to play in Europe's top competition. Pfd /lwb (Reuters, AP, Dpa) – "It is not a question of whether or not we can win the league, it is about whether we are able to win it. We will see what happens next year. It is very important to us that we have the right personnel and we will do everything in our power to bring about a change of direction in this league. That is why I am very happy to have been appointed as our coach," said Guardiola. During his time at Bayern, he has overseen a number of youth academies, including the likes of Barca, FC Sevilla and Real Betis, as well as several youth clubs. But he is also known for his ability to work with young players and develop them into players who are capable of playing in front of their own fans. At the same time, there is the issue of how well they can develop their game. They are a young team with a very young squad and they have not yet had a chance to develop into a professional team. There is no doubt that this is one of those areas in which they need to grow and improve. And that is something that has not been seen in recent years, especially in terms of our youth teams. This year, we expect to see more young talent coming into the game and that will help us develop our game, because we need them to become more mature and more experienced players, not just young ones."- The Associated Press, a press release from the Barcelona press office, said: "This is an exciting time for us as we look forward to this year's competition and the future of football in Catalonia."

He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. "FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace," the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems. Vilanova is survived by his wife and two children, including a son who now plays in Barcelona's youth academy. pfd/lw (AP, dpa, AFP) "
