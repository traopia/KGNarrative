        "story": "Italy's president Napolitano announces imminent resignation Citing his advanced age, Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano has announced his plan to resign. The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",

        "story": "Switzerland Calls on Private Security Firms for Euro 2008 In addition to enlisting foreign police during Euro 2008, Switzerland will also be bringing in private security personnel from Germany, reported a Swiss newspaper. \"We have to turn to about 500 private security personnel from Germany,\" Urs Stadler, spokesman for a security firm consortium told the Monday, May 26, edition of Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger. \"Most of them were already in operation during the World Cup two years ago, and have relevant experience,\" added Stadler from Prisec, a consortium made up of the companies Protectas and Securitas. The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests. France will offer the third largest contingent with 750 officers and Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Greece, Russia and Spain will also send reinforcements.",

        "story": "MSF says Ebola 'fast,' medics 'facing war-like scenario' The medical charity MSF has warned that western Africa's Ebola crisis is \"moving faster\" than medics can cope with. Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires \"extraordinary measures.\" The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. \"It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,\" Liu told reporters. \"Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure,\" she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",

        "story": "Oracle loses court fight over software resale rules A European court has ruled that it's permissible to resell software licenses even if the package has been downloaded directly from the Internet. It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

        "story": "NASA's 'Curiosity' readies to hit the Martian road The US space agency has said its Mars rover appears to be working \"flawlessly,\" with a lengthy period of instrument checks almost complete. The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site. The $2.5-billion (1.93-billion-euro) six-wheeled rolling science lab is designed to last two years in order to complete its Mars mission. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

Many others were wounded when the float they were traveling on made contact with a power line. Officials in Port-au-Prince said the accident occurred as thousands of revelers filled the streets of the city center of the Haitian capital in the early hours of Tuesday. The Associated Press quoted witnesses at the scene who reported seeing somebody on one of the floats used a stick or pole to move a power line so that the vehicle could pass under it. Reuters cited a witness who reported seeing the head of a singer from the hip-hop band Barikad Crew make contact with the power line. Some of the victims were electrocuted instantly, while others jumped off the float, causing panic among the revelers who lined the street. Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities. There was some confusion about the number of fatalities, with the Associated Press putting it at 20, and AFP later reported that only around 10 had died. Haitian President Michel Martelly used his Twitter account to express his condolences to the injured and bereaved. \"My sincere sympathies to the victims of the serious incident that occurred this morning at the Champ de Mars (area in downtown Port-au-Prince),\" the president said. pfd/rc (AP, Reuters, AFP)",

        "story": "Gang battle in Mexico as US' John Kelly visits A gunbattle between drug gangs in northern Mexico has left 14 people dead. It's the latest in a series of turf wars. Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels. Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump, who wants a border wall, are schedule to meet Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)",

        "story": "Nigeria sentences 54 soldiers to death for mutiny A Nigerian court martial has sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny and cowardice as they refused to fight against Boko Haram Islamists. The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",

        "story": "Commerzbank appoints Martin Zielke as new CEO Commerzbank has named Martin Zielke as its next chief executive officer, taking over from current CEO Martin Blessing on May 1. The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

        "story": "'One in three' unaware they are HIV-positive The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighboring countries has increased by nearly a third, with one in three unaware they have the virus, the EU Commission warned Monday. In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",

        "story": "UN chief warns Nepal parties over instability The UN Secretary General has voiced disappointment over the failure of divided parties to meet a deadline to draw up a constitution. Security forces are on high alert amid fears of unrest. UN leader Ban Ki-moon expressed \"deep regret\" on Monday that political leaders had failed to make progress on a constitution in Nepal, expressing concern about instability within the country. Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. \"Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period,\" Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. \"The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces,\" the statement added. Repeated deadlines expired Politicians were to have agreed upon a new framework for the country's political future by Sunday. However, the representation of ethnic minorities and castes within a federal structure has proved a major sticking point in efforts to draw up a secular constitution. Bhattarai on Sunday said that parliament, elected in 2008 after a decade of civil war, would be disbanded after repeated deadlines had been broken. New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll. The country's Hindu monarchy, which ruled for centuries, was abolished after Maoist rebels gave up arms and won elections in 2008. Some 16,000 people died in the civil war between 1996 and 2006. rc/msh (AFP, AP)",

        "story": "A Delicious Accompaniment for Wine A regular companion of the fall season's wines is a treat called Zwiebelkuchen, literally, onion cake. It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine.",

        "story": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",

        "story": "EU risks taking sides in Polish dispute, says deputy foreign minister The European Commission has launched an unprecedented procedure to review Poland's rule of law. The move has been questioned by officials, with some saying it places the EU at-risk of taking sides in an internal dispute. The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. \"I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland,\" Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering \"into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary.\" He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. \"We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about,\" Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. \"The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities,\" Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page. The Rule of Law Framework was created two years ago as a response to criticism that the 28-nation bloc had not adequately responded to possibly-authoritarian moves taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his tenure. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

        "story": "Polish government survives second confidence vote after tape scandal Poland's center-right coalition has survived a vote of no confidence. The opposition had called for the government to resign after a tape was leaked in which the Polish foreign minister bashed US and British leaders. The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as \"Waitergate.\" Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost. During the conversation, Sikorski said the US-Polish alliance was \"worthless\" and British Prime Minister David Cameron's concessions to euroskeptics had shown his \"incompetence in EU affairs.\" Prior to the leak of the Sikorski recording, Wprost also published a tape in which central bank chief Marek Belka told Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that he would only support the government's economic policy if Finance Minister Rostowski left his post. The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman. Immediately after the conversations were published, Tusk called his own vote of no confidence. His government survived that vote 237-203. slk/rc (AP, AFP, dpa)",

        "story": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

        "story": "Secretary of State John Kerry due in Cairo as Gaza death toll mounts US Secretary of State John Kerry is due in Cairo to push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas as the death toll in Gaza surpasses 500. Israel's army said several militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. \"We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza,\" spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement. Late Sunday, the United Nations Security Council in New York held urgent talks on the conflict, and expressed \"serious concern about the growing numbers of casualties.\" \"The members of the Security Council call for an immediate cessation of hostilities,\" said Rwandan ambassador Eugene Richard Gasana, whose country currently chairs the 15-member council. hc/dr (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)",

        "story": "Libya factions declare ceasefire After two days of peace talks in Geneva, a tentative ceasefire has been called in the restive North African country. Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

        "story": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets.

        "story": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

        "story": "Belarusian president accuses Germany, Poland of coup plans Before being sworn in for a fourth term, the reclusive leader of Belarus fired a warning salvo at the European Union, accusing Germany and Poland of plotting a coup and threatening action against sanctions. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

        "story": "Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Cyclist Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from cycling for life, in a much-anticipated ruling by the sport's international governing body. Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",

        "story": "How to wrap a present without using paper or tape Next time you get invited to a birthday party, you could try wrapping the present using a piece of fabric and ribbon. It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",

        "story": "European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",

Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively. Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg. Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",

        "story": "Slovaks accused of spying in Iran released Six Slovak paragliders detained in Iran since May on suspicion of spying have been released. They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",

        "story": "German Interior Ministry Claims Progress on Crime Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble released his department's official statistics concerning crime in 2006 in Berlin on Tuesday. And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",

        "story": "Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella to face Vatican trial for child pornography  A Catholic diplomat was recalled from the Washington embassy despite US requests to charge him in the country. He allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography. A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks. Read more: Australian archbishop becomes most senior cleric convicted of hiding abuse Diplomatic immunity The monsignor was recalled from the Washington embassy after US authorities alerted the Vatican to his alleged crimes and requested his diplomatic immunity be stripped. The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges. aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

        "story": "Russia to create corporate aid fund, tapping pensions Moscow is planning to set up an emergency fund to help companies hit by sanctions imposed on Russian firms over the country's role in the Ukraine crisis. The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles.

        "story": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",

        "story": "No more 'veggie sausages?' Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",

        "story": "Trudeau declares victory in Canada as Harper resigns Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party has been elected Canada's new prime minister. Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

He said that his victory meant voters had chosed the path of \"European Integration.\" Exit polls gave Petro Poroshenko, a 48-year-old billionaire and owner of a chocolate factory, between 55.9 and 57.3 percent of the vote. This put him well ahead of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was reported to have come in second, at 12.9 percent. Andrij Shevchenko, one of Tymoshenko's political allies, said on Twitter that she had conceded defeat. DW's reporter Kitty Logan in Kyiv said voter turnout was extremely high in the capital. Most polling stations in the east of the country remained closed on Sunday. If the figures are confirmed, there will not be a need for a runoff on June 15. Poroshenko, who has promised closer economic and political ties with the West, has also vowed to mend relations with Russia, but insisted that Ukraine's territorial integrity was of top importance to him.

        "story": "Ex-Euro Olympic boss Hickey released on bail in Brazil The former European Olympic Committee president Patrick Hickey - awaiting trial over an alleged ticketing scam - has been released on bail in Rio. The 71-year old can now leave the country for medical treatment. Brazilian judge Juliana Leal de Melo - who serves on a court overseeing amateur and professional sports - authorized the release of Hickey's passport upon payment of 1.5 million real ($435,000) bail. Hickey could now have medical treatment, the Rio state court system said in a statement. Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight \"each and every one\u201d of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces. Hickey, who was also the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland, was released from custody last month, but must remain in Brazil until the case is heard. \"For clarity, I am not under house arrest as, like with so many things with this case, has been misreported by the media,\u201d Hickey said in a statement on Monday. Hickey was arrested on 10 August at a luxury beachfront hotel during the games. The authorities told Reuters last week that they believe the ring had operated for around eight years and was preparing for other Olympic events such as the 2020 Tokyo Games. jbh/bw (AP, AFP)",

        "story": "Top NATO commander says Ukraine ceasefire is 'in name only' NATO's top military commander has called the truce between Ukraine's military and pro-Russia separatists a 'ceasefire in name only.' US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas. While neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of NATO, both share borders with NATO countries. se/ksb (AP, AFP)",

        "story": "For drivers in Germany, 2010 was the most expensive year ever Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds",

        "story": "Spain takes in first of five Guantanamo detainees The first of five Guantanamo inmates slated to be taken in by Spain has arrived there. The move shows Madrid's support of US efforts to close the controversial prison. Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian. The new arrival will be able to work and move around Spain as he wishes, but will not be able to leave the country. \"He is a Palestinian, he has already arrived in our country. We do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally,\" he told a news conference. Spain urges others to 'do the utmost' Spain's decision to take five Guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help US President Barack Obama with his plans to shut down the jail. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries \"to do their utmost\" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet. Some 200 detainees remain there, but finding places to take in the prisoners - even the dozens already cleared for release - has proved controversial. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer",

The base hosts Air Force One, used by President Obama. An active shooter exercise at Joint Base Andrews was mistaken for a real shooting situation on Thursday morning, triggering a lockdown at the military base that houses the president's aircraft. Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., issued a \"shelter in place\" order after an active shooter incident was reported at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility at approximately 9 am local time. The base said on Twitter that there was an active shooter exercise scheduled, but a real active shooter situation was reported. It later cleared the facility. The lockdown delayed the travel of Vice President Joe Biden, who was scheduled to fly to Ohio for a campaign event. The Joint Base Andrews is located in Camp Springs, Maryland, just outside the US capital. The base serves as the home of Air Force One, the US president's aircraft, and is used by other senior government officials.",

        "story": "Former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova loses battle with cancer Former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova has died from the cancer that forced him to retire from football at the end of last season. He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. \"FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems. Vilanova is survived by his wife and two children, including a son who now plays in Barcelona's youth academy. pfd/lw (AP, dpa, AFP)",
