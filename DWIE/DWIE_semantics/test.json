    "story": "German Publishers Warm to Google Library Google is heading for a legal battle with American publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries. But German publishers seem warm to the idea. Five major US publishers filed suit in San Francisco on Wednesday to block Google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders. The project, already underway but stopped by Google in August, is the Silicon Valley company's bid to make the world's books searchable online. Five major libraries are already participating in the project and Google sent executive Jennifer Grant to the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday to present the idea to European and German book publishers. This week Google introduced print.google.de, the German version of the search engine Google posted online this time last year. Google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned. Users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online. The idea is to supplement Internet users with another source of material. In contrast to their American colleagues, German publishing houses have reacted well to the database. Some German publishers on board Google said that is discussing terms with all major German publishers. Langenscheidt, which publishes a large selection of dictionaries, said they had got on board. \"We are starting with 160 books,\" Hubert Haarmann, head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher, told the Financial Times Deutschland. \"We see it as an additional distribution possibility.\" An increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way Google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers. The company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine, and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books. Google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site. Not all German publishers are on board. In fact, the German association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books, rather than let someone else do it. The project is not a competitor to Google, but will allow publishers to create their own database, rather than turn it over to the search engine. If Google can, anyone can But American publishers don't want to even take that step. They fear a slippery slope if Google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material. \"If Google can make \u2026 copies, then anyone can,\" Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, said in a phone interview with Reuters. \"Anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything.\" At issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the \"fair use\" of their work by the public. Google argues that their search engine will only offer users a \"card catalog\" function, with a few pages of text. No one will be able to read the entire book online.",

    "story": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",

    "story": "Italy's president Napolitano announces imminent resignation Citing his advanced age, Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano has announced his plan to resign. The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",

    "story": "'Bond between Israel and the US is unshakeable' Israel\u2019s former deputy foreign minister and Israeli Ambassador to the US Danny Ayalon spoke to DW this week about whether the Iranian nuclear deal has been a game changer in the relations between the US and Israel. Danny Ayalon has served as Israel's deputy foreign minister and was Ambassador to the US from 2002-2006. DW: Have US-Israeli relations been damaged in light of the Geneva agreement? Danny Ayalon: Israel-US relations will not be affected by the agreement in Geneva with Iran. Yes, we do have our apprehensions; we do have our criticisms; but this is something that is legitimate between allies just as we have our different points of view about settlements, or about what should be the content of agreement with the Palestinians. The unshakeable bond between Israel and US is going to last on the natural alliance and political-strategical value of this alliance. Israel has proven again to be the only dependable ally for the US in the region in terms of American interests; in terms of countering and fighting proliferation of nuclear weapons - which is one of the most important things for American stability. How would you characterize relations at the moment between the US and Iran? I think it's very important to note that under President Obama the military cooperation and relationship between Israel and the US has reached an all time high and this continues. It's not just the administration though, it's also Congress, it's the people and the nationwide support that Israel enjoys in the US. This will not change although Israel has criticized and will continue to criticize the agreement with Iran. What do you think is behind the thinking of the Iranian leadership? The Iranians see two models - in terms of non-proliferation or in terms of dismantling the nuclear capabilities. They see Libya under the Gadhafi model and they see the North Korean model. Libya under Gadhafi voluntarily dismantled their capabilities and where is Libya now, where is Gadhafi now? On the other hand a decade ago the North Koreans went through what seemed like a consensual route and, boom, after a few years they detonated a nuclear device. For the Ayatollahs the nuclear capability is not just an objective in itself, it's a means for two things - to become the hegemony and the dominant force in the Middle East; secondly to put down the Sunii countries like Saudi Arabia and lastly their own internal stability. By becoming nuclear they believe it will be an insurance policy for them. The six parties involved in talks in Geneva should not be fooled by the charm offense of the Iranians because the Iranians came to Geneva not as a consequence of a policy change but as a consequence of their being on the brink economically. The main goal of Iran is to lift the sanctions and they have managed to do that without giving up any of their potential. Why does Israel's leadership think the Geneva agreement is bad? I believe that this agreement is bad on all accounts. It's not going to stop a nuclear Iran. Because of the message, it's going to make stabilizing the region much more difficult. It's going to induce more negative energy into the region in terms of terrorism, in terms of the Sunni-Shia clashes and it's quite obvious to foes and friends alike of the West that Iran has the upper hand. The danger is that Iran keeps the nuclear potential, the capabilities and the initiative in the hands of Ayatollahs. Any time in the future they can resume, they can actually accelerate their nuclear programme. The fact that Iran was on brink was not used well diplomatically by the six parties in the talks, because they could have gotten much more out of Iran. Iran played a brilliant game when they made the P5+1 blink first. The message to the region is that the belligerency of Iran pays off and that strengthens Assad, Hezbollah and all the very extreme radical forces. It also creates the counter offensive by the Sunni extremists. Where does this leave Israel? I think Israel's hands are now tied and there is no option at this point but the diplomatic option. Now it's just a matter of keeping Iran committed and answerable to the letter of the Geneva agreement. I don't think that this will be very simple to do. If a country is determined they can really overcome any monitoring regime, even the most robust. The last opportunity the international community has will be when the terms of the agreement are up in six months. When the P5+1 comes to the table for the final status agreement with Iran, this is the time to make all the demands with Iran. I don't think Middle East and the world can tolerate, or survive a nuclear Iran. Unfortunately it's been painted as if the duel in the Middle East is between Tehran and Jerusalem. It's not the case. The the threat of Tehran is first and foremost to the Gulf countries, to the Sunni countries, then to Israel and then to Europe. If you look at their delivery systems and their ideology it does not stop only in the Middle East. Are there influential, important political voices in Israel that would advocate military action? I would say nobody would advocate military action, this is not our preferred way to solve the Iranian threat. I believe that we still have a few months before we see the development especially on the comprehensive agreement with Iran. But to say that this is not an option, I think is a mistake. Israel does have the capabilities if they needed to. I am not advocating this, but it should not be ruled out. Has Israel made any mistakes in the past in dealing with Iran and what would you suggest Israel does in the future? I don't think Israel made any mistakes, I think it was not in Israel's interest to make it look like it's a duel between Jerusalem and Tehran. Israel represents the entire international community's interest. In terms of raising the awareness internationally about a threat from Iran, I think that we did a pretty good job. It was Israel who was the first in 1996 to realize and analyze the ambitions of Iran. At that time it was very difficult to mobilize international interest on Iran and people were looking at it in a skeptical way, but we were proven right. What we could do we have already done. Of course we now have to consider our own national security. I think we have to reserve all the options. I have no doubt that it would be much better for an international coalition to take care, if need be, to militarily dismantle Iran. It's much better than if Israel did it. The option should be kept on the table if we want to see peaceful diplomatic results. As for the future, aside from conservation and back door diplomacy, I don't think there is much more we can do.",

    "story": "Switzerland Calls on Private Security Firms for Euro 2008 In addition to enlisting foreign police during Euro 2008, Switzerland will also be bringing in private security personnel from Germany, reported a Swiss newspaper. \"We have to turn to about 500 private security personnel from Germany,\" Urs Stadler, spokesman for a security firm consortium told the Monday, May 26, edition of Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger. \"Most of them were already in operation during the World Cup two years ago, and have relevant experience,\" added Stadler from Prisec, a consortium made up of the companies Protectas and Securitas. The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests. France will offer the third largest contingent with 750 officers and Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Greece, Russia and Spain will also send reinforcements.",

    "story": "Germany won't tolerate 'Sharia police' The German government has strongly criticized nightly patrols in the city of Wuppertal by men calling themselves \"Sharia police.\" The 33-year-old behind the patrols claimed that their goal was only to raise attention. Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

    "story": "Will Berlin be the next city to ban plastic bags? They are sturdy, thin and can handle a heavy load, but after a single use, plastic bags often end up outdoors or in oceans - with disastrous impacts. But a student in Berlin is trying to halt the plastic bag invasion. It started off as a student job: Stefanie Albrecht contacted the environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe to support its campaign in Berlin of approaching citizens on the streets to swap their plastic bags for reusable bags. The organization hoped to make people more aware of the environmentally destructive effects of plastic bags. Deutsche Umwelthilfe's anti-plastic bag campaign on Saturday (20.09.2014) also reused the bags campaigners collected off the streets. About 1,000 people strung together a 9-kilometer-long chain made of 30,000 plastic bags at the Tempelhofer Feld in the German capital Berlin, creating a world record. In Berlin alone, 30,000 plastic bags leave shops and market stalls every hour - amounting to 259 million bags a year. Across Germany, about 17 million plastic bags are consumed every day - or 6 billion a year. Albrecht, a natural resources management student, buys secondhand clothes, grows her own vegetables and tries to reduce her rubbish. But even she hadn't always been so conscious of the environmental problem that plastic bags present. \"Before, I never thought about plastics and crude oil,\" she said. Stimulated by the conversations she had with strangers in the streets, she was motivated to sensitize others on the issue. In reading studies on polyethylene bags, she found out that 260 million liters (1.6 million barrels) of crude oil are processed into the plastic bags used over one year in Germany alone - not to mention the energy also needed in oil extraction and bag production. Eco-threat Plastic presents so many advantages: it is lightweight, strong, durable, waterproof, and cheap to produce. After the first department store in Germany started handing out plastic bags in 1961, many retailers followed. This packaging can be reused many times, and it is also recyclable. But because they are given away, plastic bags are carelessly disposed of: a plastic bag is typically used for 25 minutes on average - from the shop until you get back home. Plastic degrades very slowly in nature, over 100 to 500 years. In fact it never actually biodegrades - plastic just breaks down into ever-smaller pieces. And they can have fatal effects in the environment. Many places on land and water have become covered in a layer of plastic bags, bottles, canisters, furniture, forks and toothbrushes. In the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a swirling island of plastic trash covers thousands of square kilometers. Plastic bags cause wild animals to die miserably. Animals think the plastic is food, and eat it. This can cause them to choke, and suffocate slowly. Or they starve to death: the material can't be digested and excreted, so it clogs the stomach and intestines. Animals can also get caught and strangle themselves in plastic; or it can cut off circulation to a limb, leading to a different type of slow and painful death. Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) recently found plastic in every second seabird off the coast of Australia. CSIRO has warned that continued plastic production could cause extinction of 95 percent of all living animals in the region by 2050. Fish, sea turtles, whales, dolphins, sea cows, crocodiles and crustaceans could all go the way of the dodo. Economic approach Stefanie Albrecht was shocked to learn all this. Together with the Deutsche Umwelthilfe, she collected signatures on the online petition platform Change.org to demand that the German government enact a law taxing thin plastic bags. Within only three weeks, the 100,000 signatures for that online petition had been gathered. Stefanie Albrecht is now planning to personally hand over the list to the German government. Other countries are ahead of Germany: retailers in Ireland have been taxing plastic bags since 2002. There, consumption of plastic bags has decreased from 328 to 16 on average per person due to the tax. In Germany, annual consumption is at 76 plastic bags per head - a lot lower than the European average of 198 bags. \"Germany has more than 80 million inhabitants. By reducing our per person consumption, we can achieve greater impact than many other countries in the European Union,\" pointed out Thomas Fischer of Deutsche Umwelthilfe. A minimum charge of 22 cents could cause the consumer to rethink his plastic bag habit: \"Do I really need this bag, or can I put the goods in my backpack?\" Fischer said in describing the hypothetical question. Bans in other areas In Bangladesh, plastic bags were banned after plastic waste clogged sewers and led to flooding in 1988 and 1998. China, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa have also banned ultra-thin plastic bags. Many cities in the United States have been jumping on the plastic-bag-ban bandwagon - including Chicago, most recently. The EU is also considering a resolution to reduce the consumption in member states by 80 percent over five years, although Fischer criticized this as lacking clarity. Bags made of biodegradable materials don't present the best alternative, either. \"Biodegradable\" plastic bags only consist of 30 percent renewable raw materials and 70 percent crude oil, said Fischer from the Deutsche Umwelthilfe. And bags made of bioplastics, or out of materials like corn starch, still require a large amount of raw materials in their production. The best alternative is to use bags over and over again, for example those made of cloth.",

    "story": "MSF says Ebola 'fast,' medics 'facing war-like scenario' The medical charity MSF has warned that western Africa's Ebola crisis is \"moving faster\" than medics can cope with. Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires \"extraordinary measures.\" The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. \"It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,\" Liu told reporters. \"Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure,\" she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",

    "story": "Oracle loses court fight over software resale rules A European court has ruled that it's permissible to resell software licenses even if the package has been downloaded directly from the Internet. It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

    "story": "NASA's 'Curiosity' readies to hit the Martian road The US space agency has said its Mars rover appears to be working \"flawlessly,\" with a lengthy period of instrument checks almost complete. The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site. The $2.5-billion (1.93-billion-euro) six-wheeled rolling science lab is designed to last two years in order to complete its Mars mission. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

    "story": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",

    "story": "All Eyes on Kimi and Ferdy on Schumi's Turf All eyes will be on a Finn and a Spaniard at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim on Sunday as the title battle between Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso looks to put local hero Michael Schumacher in the shade. It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",

    "story": "US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",

    "story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",

    "story": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",

    "story": "Emmerson Mnangagwa declared winner in Zimbabwe presidential election Zimbabwe's electoral commission has declared Emmerson Mnangagwa president with 50.8 percent of the vote. Calling the results \"fake,\" opposition candidate Nelson Chamisa has vowed to launch a legal challenge. The electoral commission announced the presidential election results province by province, declaring ZANU-PF candidate Emmerson Mnangagwa president by the closest of margins. The announcement came after clashes between opposition protesters and soldiers in Harare left at least six people dead on Thursday. The unrest marred what had been billed as an important milestone in Zimbabwe's efforts to return to democracy following 37 years of repression under longtime leader Robert Mugabe. In a press conference on Friday, Mnangagwa said there would be an independent investigation into the post-election violence. He also called on the opposition to help him bring about peace and unity, declaring that he would serve all Zimbabweans, including those who didn't vote for him. \"Here was a celebration of Zimbabwean democracy, a festival of unfettered freedom. With the eyes of the world on us we delivered a free, fair and credible election,\" he said. Opposition challenges results Mnangagwa, 75, won 50.8 percent of the vote, ahead of Nelson Chamisa of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party with 44.3 percent, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) said. Chamisa, 40, has dismissed what he called \"unverified fake results,\" and said the MDC planned to challenge the outcome of the \"rigged\" election. But the ZANU-PF youth spokesman, Tonderai Bosha, told DW on Friday that the opposition would not accept an election loss. \"The opposition is saying we rigged the election. That has been the narrative during the campaigns, before the elections,\" Tonderai said in Harare. \"What they only wanted was victory on their side. If it's victory on ZANU-PF side, it's not victory.\" After the first four of 10 provincial results, Chamisa's MDC had a lead of about 50,000 votes over the ruling ZANU-PF. But after the fifth province was announced, the lead had switched to Mnangagwa. He quickly took to Twitter to hail what he called \"a new beginning.\" To become president, a candidate has to take more than 50 percent of the vote. Chamisa did well in urban areas, but Mnangagwa outperformed him among rural voters. Chamisa said police raided opposition headquarters in Harare and seized computers. The search warrant indicated they were looking for unlicensed firearms, grenades and stones. Police said 16 people in the offices were arrested. Riot police later briefly disrupted a press conference where Chamisa was scheduled to speak. The opposition indicated it would challenge the result in the courts. \"What they have been trying to do of late is to play around,\" Chamisa told reporters hours before the final results. \"That is rigging, that is manipulation, trying to bastardize the result, and that we will not allow.\" Other results announced by the electoral commission: The ruling ZANU-PF party won 144 of the 210 seats in parliament \u2014 a two-thirds majority which enables it to change the constitution. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) took at least 61 seats. Observers highlight flaws Elmar Brok, chief observer for the EU's election monitor mission in Zimbabwe, told DW that the vote was marred by a \"lot of shortcomings in favor of the ruling party,\" including through \"financing, state media, intimidation, especially in the countryside.\" Late Friday, the US said it was reviewing the election results. \"The United States will continue to review the data collected by its own observation teams, by international observation missions and by local observers to make a complete assessment of the overall election,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged all sides to act peacefully and called on the political parties \"to show magnanimity in victory and graciousness in defeat.\" Zimbabwe Electoral Commission chairwoman Priscilla Chigumba has denied allegations of bias and strongly disputed accusations of rigging. Read more: Deadly clashes erupt over election 'results manipulation' Turning the page: This week's elections were seen as an important step in Zimbabwe's efforts to break with the repressive rule of Robert Mugabe, who was ousted from power last year. Despite reports that the vote had gone off peacefully, international observers voiced concerns about irregularities and a lack of trust in the polling process. Officials also criticized the delay in announcing the results of the presidential race, saying it had undermined the vote's credibility. There is now the challenging task of uniting the country and reviving an economy that's been badly battered by years of international isolation. Read more: Zimbabwe election unlikely to solve country's economic woes Post-Mugabe vote: Under Mugabe, 94, the country went from being a prosperous economy to a pariah state wrecked by mismanagement and corruption. Elections during his rule were largely marked by repression and fraud allegations. His successor, Mnangagwa, had promised a free and fair vote, inviting EU observers for the first time since 2002. Who is Emmerson Mnangagwa? Mugabe's former deputy president and right-hand man was the clear favorite to win the presidential race. Sometimes dubbed \"The Crocodile\" for his ruthlessness during his years as Mugabe's state security chief, Mnangagwa has tried to cast himself as a forward-looking reformer. Following independence in 1980, he allegedly was partially responsible for a brutal crackdown on opposition supporters that claimed thousands of lives in Matabeleland. The ZANU-PF veteran was also allegedly involved in deadly violence against the opposition during the 2008 elections. nm,jm/rc (Reuters, AFP) Columbus Mavhunga contributed reporting from Harare.

    "story": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in power anymore. What his father did, what he did, we want this regime to end. We just want to be free, we want to talk without being afraid.\"",

    "story": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution.

    "story": "At least 18 people killed in Haiti Carnival mishap At least 18 people are reported to have been killed in an accident during Carnival festivities in Haiti. Many others were wounded when the float they were traveling on made contact with a power line. Officials in Port-au-Prince said the accident occurred as thousands of revelers filled the streets of the city center of the Haitian capital in the early hours of Tuesday. The Associated Press quoted witnesses at the scene who reported seeing somebody on one of the floats used a stick or pole to move a power line so that the vehicle could pass under it. Reuters cited a witness who reported seeing the head of a singer from the hip-hop band Barikad Crew make contact with the power line. Some of the victims were electrocuted instantly, while others jumped off the float, causing panic among the revelers who lined the street. Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities. There was some confusion about the number of fatalities, with the Associated Press putting it at 20, and AFP later reported that only around 10 had died. Haitian President Michel Martelly used his Twitter account to express his condolences to the injured and bereaved. \"My sincere sympathies to the victims of the serious incident that occurred this morning at the Champ de Mars (area in downtown Port-au-Prince),\" the president said. pfd/rc (AP, Reuters, AFP)",

    "story": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing the Musudan missiles under pressure from Beijing is a positive development. \"It's good to know that there is a red line that China is willing to enforce,\" he said. \"This makes the achievement of a tolerable modus vivendi significantly more likely.\" If North Korea fails to stick to that script, Okumura agreed, \"a post-dynasty, puppet regime comes across as plausible.\"",

    "story": "Gang battle in Mexico as US' John Kelly visits A gunbattle between drug gangs in northern Mexico has left 14 people dead. It's the latest in a series of turf wars. Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels.

    "story": "Nigeria sentences 54 soldiers to death for mutiny A Nigerian court martial has sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny and cowardice as they refused to fight against Boko Haram Islamists. The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",

    "story": "Commerzbank appoints Martin Zielke as new CEO Commerzbank has named Martin Zielke as its next chief executive officer, taking over from current CEO Martin Blessing on May 1. The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",

    "story": "UN chief warns Nepal parties over instability The UN Secretary General has voiced disappointment over the failure of divided parties to meet a deadline to draw up a constitution. Security forces are on high alert amid fears of unrest. UN leader Ban Ki-moon expressed \"deep regret\" on Monday that political leaders had failed to make progress on a constitution in Nepal, expressing concern about instability within the country. Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. \"Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period,\" Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. \"The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces,\" the statement added. Repeated deadlines expired Politicians were to have agreed upon a new framework for the country's political future by Sunday. However, the representation of ethnic minorities and castes within a federal structure has proved a major sticking point in efforts to draw up a secular constitution. Bhattarai on Sunday said that parliament, elected in 2008 after a decade of civil war, would be disbanded after repeated deadlines had been broken. New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll. The country's Hindu monarchy, which ruled for centuries, was abolished after Maoist rebels gave up arms and won elections in 2008. Some 16,000 people died in the civil war between 1996 and 2006. rc/msh (AFP, AP)",

    "story": "A Delicious Accompaniment for Wine A regular companion of the fall season's wines is a treat called Zwiebelkuchen, literally, onion cake. It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine.",

    "story": "The Hui - China's preferred Muslims? While the Muslim Uighurs are increasingly being persecuted, the largest Chinese-Muslim minority, the Hui, are under less scrutiny and thriving as a religious community. DW examines the reasons behind this phenomenon. Walking through the Muslim quarter of Xi'an is a fascinating venture into a hodge-podge of cultures. The smell of lamb skewers and hot spices wafts through the crowded streets. Chinese-looking women in headscarfs stretch noodles, while an old man with a white prayer hat stands in front of a mosque with a distinctly Chinese arched roof. This is the home of the Xi'an Hui Muslim people, where Islam was introduced to China for the first time in the 7th century. China's Muslim population now numbers 23 million, of which over 10 million are estimated to be Hui, and a little under 10 million Uighur. While their fellow Muslim Uighurs in the Xingjiang Uighur Autonomous Region are experiencing severe restrictions on their religious freedoms, the Hui mostly practice their faith openly, and in certain areas are enjoying a resurgence in their religious participation. The reason for their success has to do with centuries of remarkable assimilation, while also maintaining their identity. A history of assimilation Historically, the Hui people are descendants of Persian, Arab and Mongol merchants on the Silk Road, who came to China over 1,200 years ago. Since then, intermarriages with the Han Chinese have meant that the Hui became ethnically mixed and spread across the country. Over the centuries, the Han and Hui have lived relatively peacefully next to and with each other. The Hui took the path of assimilation, speak Mandarin and adapted their religious traditions to the local customs. One of the most visual examples of this is the great mosque of Xi'an, said to be one of the largest and oldest in China. The place of worship is built up of multiple courtyards and sports arches and tiled roofs that clearly show influences of traditional Chinese architecture. While some Hui now live a life culturally and religiously indistinguishable from Han Chinese in first-tier cities such as Shanghai or Beijing, many cities in China have a significant Hui Muslim minority population with close-knit communities, especially in the northern provinces of Ningxia, Gangsu or Quinghai. Traditionally traders, many Hui people are also economically successful today, and according to estimates, their religious participation is growing. Increasing religiosity Dru Gladney, professor at Pomona College in California and leading scholar on the Hui people, estimates that today there are twice as many mosques in China as there were in 1950, of which a majority were built by Hui Muslims. \"The amount of practising Muslims among the Hui is rising,\" Gladney told DW. \"For example, there is a dramatic increase in the number of Hui women wearing the Hijab.\" Gladley adds that \"the numbers of Hui going on the Haj are going up constantly.\" One of the reasons for this is the increased communication with other Muslim groups and the ensuing influence of outside Islam \u2013 either through Hui scholars returning from the Haj or from increased business relationships with the Middle East. Trade between China and the Middle East is growing ever more important for the communist country. As a measure to attract Arab business, Yinchuan, the capital city of Ningxia and one of the Hui hubs, has gotten a makeover. Construction of a new $3.7 billion Islamic theme park called World Muslim City is underway, and Arabic lettering has been added to the city's street signs. Haiyun Ma, a Hui scholar at Frostberg University takes a critical position with regard to the Chinese government's perceived friendliness toward the Hui. She told DW that it is more of a sign of \"business interest, not of religious tolerance.\" On the business side, Hui Muslims do play a role as middlemen in trade between the Middle East and China. Because of their knowledge of Arabic, numerous Hui people are working in Dubai, and for Middle Eastern businesses in China. Keeping out of politics Another reason for the Hui's relative freedom are the characteristics that distinguish them from the Uighurs. The second-largest Muslim minority is ethnically distinct, and does not speak Mandarin as a first language. Most importantly, they have a homeland that they wish to claim. The majority of Uighurs live in the far-western province of Xinjiang. Many of the ethno-religious group seek independence from China, and the Uighurs as such are oppressed for it. During this year's Ramadan, they were forced to break fast and parts of their community were not allowed to attend prayers or travel. Most recently, all citizens of Xinjiang were ordered to hand in their passports. But the Hui, partly also due to their diversity and geographic diaspora, and partly because of their cultural closeness to Han Chinese, have no political aspirations of independence, Gladney said. Periods of turmoil This does not mean that the Han and Hui have always got along well. The Dungan revolt in the 1860s and 1870s saw an uprising of Muslim and Hui people against the Han. The Hui were also oppressed by the government during the Cultural Revolution, along with most religious and ethnic minorities. In 1975, hundreds of Hui were killed when a separatist movement was suppressed by the People's Liberation Army in the southern town of Shadian. While friendliness toward outside Muslims with business intentions is mounting, and numbers suggest that religious activities are on the rise, the Hui may have to be on the watch out for another shift in China. \"In the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult for Hui Muslims in provinces such as Ningxia to apply for passports, and religious education has been restricted,\" the Hui scholar Ma observed. \"The control and mounting nationalism of the Chinese government are a threat to the Hui.\"",

    "story": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",

    "story": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",

    "story": "EU risks taking sides in Polish dispute, says deputy foreign minister The European Commission has launched an unprecedented procedure to review Poland's rule of law. The move has been questioned by officials, with some saying it places the EU at-risk of taking sides in an internal dispute. The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. \"I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland,\" Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering \"into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary.\" He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. \"We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about,\" Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. \"The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities,\" Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page. The Rule of Law Framework was created two years ago as a response to criticism that the 28-nation bloc had not adequately responded to possibly-authoritarian moves taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his tenure. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

    "story": "Polish government survives second confidence vote after tape scandal Poland's center-right coalition has survived a vote of no confidence. The opposition had called for the government to resign after a tape was leaked in which the Polish foreign minister bashed US and British leaders. The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as \"Waitergate.\" Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost. During the conversation, Sikorski said the US-Polish alliance was \"worthless\" and British Prime Minister David Cameron's concessions to euroskeptics had shown his \"incompetence in EU affairs.\" Prior to the leak of the Sikorski recording, Wprost also published a tape in which central bank chief Marek Belka told Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that he would only support the government's economic policy if Finance Minister Rostowski left his post. The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman. Immediately after the conversations were published, Tusk called his own vote of no confidence. His government survived that vote 237-203. slk/rc (AP, AFP, dpa)",

    "story": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to put up with high mortality rates until researchers like Papendieck can find a treatment for the mite that's been plaguing Apis mellifera for over two decades.

    "story": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",

    "story": "PM Modi looking to buttress India-US ties Modi is all set to start his fourth trip to the US after becoming Indian premier, in a sign of deepening Indo-US political and military engagement amid China's growing clout and assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region. Indian PM Narendra Modi will be in Washington on June 7-8 as part of a whirlwind five-nation tour, covering Afghanistan, Qatar, Switzerland, the US and Mexico. This is Modi's fourth trip to the US after taking office as prime minister, and the Indian leader's schedule in the US capital includes holding talks with President Barack Obama and other top administration officials as well as addressing a joint session of Congress. Modi's trip \"reflects the significance that the two leaders place on the natural alliance between the two largest democratic countries of the world,\" a State Department spokesperson told news agency PTI. The discussions between the two sides are expected to focus on deepening bilateral defense partnership as well as ways to boost US investment into India, particularly in the energy sector. Trade and defense There is talk of a potential multibillion dollar deal with the US electric giant Westinghouse to build a nuclear power plant in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. If struck, it would mark the first contract reached under the 2008 US-India civil nuclear accord and pave the way for closer cooperation between the two sides in this arena. PM Modi also wants to use the trip to push for increased trade between India and the US, targeting an almost five-fold rise in bilateral commerce from the currently estimated $120 billion to some $500 billion. Furthermore, both sides have expanded military-to-military exchanges, and the US has emerged as a major arms supplier to India in recent years - selling weapons worth about $14 billion over the past five years. There are also reports of both navies looking at ways to cooperate in the area of anti-submarine warfare, in a bid to help each other detect and track submarines in the Indian Ocean. China concerns The broadening and deepening of ties between the world's two biggest democracies comes amid China's assertive rise in the Asia-Pacific region, where Beijing's expansive territorial claims and aggressive stance in the South and East China Seas have alarmed many of its neighbors. India, too, has a long-simmering border dispute with China, and both nations fought a brief but bloody war in 1962. \"In light of China's growing assertive behavior, the Modi government has not been reluctant to highlight its convergence with Washington on regional issues,\" Vindu Mai Chotani, a researcher at the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation, told DW. Indeed, in their recent high-level joint statements, both India and the US repeatedly declared their support for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Both nations also highlight their convergence based on democratic values, and respect for rule of law, Vindu Mai noted. In addition, India's engagements with US allies in the region like Japan, Australia and the Philippines have strengthened. At the same time, India and Vietnam have been cooperating on joint oil exploration as well as in the area of maritime security. China has expressed its concern over these developments as well as deepening Indo-US ties, especially on issues such as the inclusion of Japan as a regular member of the Malabar Exercise, a naval drill held annually by the US and India. \"The most important takeaway here is that Beijing views Washington's actions, especially in the Asia-Pacific, as the US containment of China,\" underlined Vindu Mai, stressing that it's therefore difficult for China to see the US engagement with India in a different light. An array of challenges But observers say there are limitations to how far both India and the US are willing to go to forge closer defense ties, despite their mutual interest in ensuring China's peaceful rise. While the US has been pushing for pacts such as a military logistics sharing agreement - which will allow the two militaries to use each other's bases - India has expressed a raft of concerns over these deals, experts point out. \"One issue being expressed by Indian policy makers is that the signing of these agreements would lock the country in an irreversible strategic partnership with the US,\" says Vindu Mai, adding that, \"India does not wish to be seen as a strategic ally of the US against China.\" Furthermore, the US relationship with Pakistan continues to loom large over India-US ties, with New Delhi looking warily at Washington's supplies of aid and armaments - such as F-16 fighter jets - to Islamabad. In the US, meanwhile, there is growing criticism over rising religious intolerance in the South Asian nation and increased restrictions on civil society organizations such as the environmental NGO Greenpeace and the US-based Ford Foundation. Discord over human rights \"In the case of US-India relations, the hopeful rhetoric has far exceeded actual, tangible achievements,\" Bob Corker, Republican Senator and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told a hearing last month. And during a recent speech in New Delhi, Senator Benjamin L. Cardin called on India to step up its efforts to tackle discrimination in society and address issues such as human trafficking, gender violence and religious intolerance. India, however, rejects US criticism of the country's human rights record, and the Indian government recently refused visas for a delegation from the US government agency charged with monitoring international religious freedom. Even Modi's personal relationship with the US has been a mixed bag, with the Indian leader barred from setting foot on US soil for a decade prior to his becoming prime minister. Washington revoked Modi's visa in 2005 arguing that he had not done enough to stop communal violence in 2002 when he was chief minister of the state of Gujarat. Over a 1,000 people lost their lives during the riots.",

    "story": "Refugees in Germany: 'I want to integrate, but how?' Refugees are constantly told that they need to integrate. How are they dealing with that task? Impressions from a Berlin refugee home gathered by DW's Jaafar Abdul Karim. \"Do you know the word 'integration'?\" I ask a young man that I meet in a Berlin refugee home. \"No,\" he says. Then I use the Arabic word \"indimaj.\" He immediately answers: \"I want to integrate, to learn the language and become part of society.\" He continues that, unfortunately, he has no idea how he is supposed to go about doing so. Adham Ali is 21 and comes from Syria. He has been living in Germany for six months. Until a week ago he was living in a gymnasium in the Spandau district of Berlin with 700 other young men. \"Now I am in the refugee home all day. I am trying to learn German via YouTube because I cannot find a spot in a language course.\" I ask if he has any German friends. He replies: \"Where and how should I meet Germans?\" More than a million refugees came to Germany last year. People like Adham. Many live in a bubble, in refugee housing, cut off from the outside world. They are, however, aware of the fact that Germany is talking about them and their integration. And many realize that it won't be easy. He knows the issue regarding German values, says Adham - about equal rights for men and women, respecting the constitution, accepting homosexuality. He comes from a small village outside Damascus. \"The women there all wear niqab,\" he says, refering to the head-covering veil that only leaves the eyes visible. Apparently there is no one to help people like Adham Ali find a way to reconcile their old lives with their new ones. I had that impression often during my visit to the refugee home. Some, like Adham, are full of hope nevertheless. He says he wants to continue the law studies that he began in Syria. 'I feel lost' Others are frustrated. Like Raafat Hajir, a 24-year-old Palestinian from Syria. \"What do you do all day?\" I ask him in Arabic. \"I get up, have breakfast, hang around, go to the gym,\" he says. \"Can you speak German?\" I ask him in German. \"Yes,\" he says, and tells me that when he arrived he took a German class that he paid for himself, but now he doesn't have any more money. He tells me that as a stateless person he has no right to state-sponsored German courses. Obviously no one has informed him that the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has just changed that rule. He says, \"I am a dentist and could work, but what am I supposed to do? I am not allowed to work here!\" He even thought about working illegally, but decided against it. He is stuck in limbo. \"What is the plan? What can I do to integrate myself into society?\" he asks me. He doesn't have any German friends to help him get a start. \"How should I meet Germans? Just approach them on the street?\" He says he knows a lot of young men that are in the same situation. A few months ago I wrote about integration in my column, about how unproductive it is that many refugees are not allowed to work for months at a time. Back then I proposed a step-by-step plan for integration. Now, a half year later, I am plagued by the feeling that we are still loitering at the bottom of my proposed \"integration pyramid.\" The refugees are here, but we are leaving them to deal with their future on their own. They are sitting around in refugee homes with nothing to do. We are producing frustration in exponential doses. I ask myself: Are those young men, who have no everyday perspective, not the perfect victims for radicals who promise to help them find a purpose in life? Many refugees in Germany have no idea what their rights and responsibilities are. No plan, no idea. Where are the authorities? Why are these young men being abandoned? Do we not want to integrate them, or are we unable to? Why are we constantly talking about them as people that do not want to integrate? If we do not want to make them part of society, then they will not want to make Germany part of their lives either. Demand rather than encourage Many politicians tell refugees: Integrate yourselves, accept our values! Some even threaten: Those who refuse to participate in integration courses should be punished and not be allowed to remain in Germany. The new integration law that the coalition has just passed is also supposed to contain that threat as well. That is why the refugee organization Pro Asyl has dubbed it the \"disintegration law\": There is no lack of will on the part of refugees, but rather of offers from the federal government. The young men that I met want to learn German, but they cannot because there simply aren't enough openings for them. There are supposed to be 300,000 such openings, but 800,000 are needed. Thus, the dentist cannot work, and Adham cannot continue his studies. Do they respect our values, accept women's rights, the constitution and homosexuality? That is meant to be the touchstone. But how are refugees supposed to meet Germans, how are they supposed to learn these things, if there aren't any possibilities to do so? We are asking a lot, but the preconditions are lacking. Do the politicians that are threatening and complaining know that? Or are they simply trying to divert attention from their own failings? The rhetoric of threat is dangerous, because it gives the impression that anti-immigrant groups like Pegida & Co. are correct in their prejudices. In fact, most refugees want to learn German, to work and to integrate. Sure, there are exceptions. But generalizations don't help. Talk with refugees, not about refugees.",

    "story": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement.

    "story": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",

    "story": "White House ignored multiple warnings about crisis in Egypt There's a general consensus among policymakers and analysts that the uprisings in Egypt and elsewhere were unpredictable. That's untrue. There were plenty of experts who warned concretely about an impending crisis. When hundreds of thousands took to the streets first in Tunis, then in Cairo, Western governments were caught off guard just as much as the dictatorial regimes that were the target of the protests. The US, arguably the country with the strongest interests and the most leverage in the region, was still scrambling to make sense of Tunisian President Ben Ali's swift exit when the next regime, this time in Egypt, crumbled. Without a clear crisis management plan at the ready, the Obama administration's reaction to the events in Cairo waffled between tenuous support for the protestors and continued allegiance with the Mubarak regime, a key US partner in the Middle East. Taken by surprise The remark by Vice President Joe Biden, probably the Obama administration's most experienced foreign policymaker, in the midst of Egypt's uprising that he wouldn't classify Hosni Mubarak as a dictator serves perhaps as the most telling sign that the US government was unprepared for the events that rocked the Middle East. But as it turned out the vast network of US intelligence services was apparently equally flabbergasted by the revolt in Egypt as their political counterparts. While the CIA director's statement before Congress that there was a \"strong likelihood\" that Hosni Mubarak would step down the same night proved wrong and made the most headlines, the more damaging remark actually came from Leon Panetta's boss. The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, testified before Congress that Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood was \"largely secular\" and \"eschewed violence\" only to have his statement later corrected by a spokesman. President Barack Obama, according to a February 4 article in the New York Times, was unhappy with the information and analysis he received on the uprising in the Middle East by his intelligence services. Internal White House study on Egypt However, instead of relying on the CIA and others to prognosticate events in Egypt and elsewhere the president could have simply turned to his own advisors. As reported by the New York Times, Obama himself commissioned a secret review of possible unrest in the Middle East back in August 2010. The so-called Presidential Study Directive concluded that numerous countries in the region were prone to mass unrest without serious political changes, wrote the paper. The 18-page report so far hasn't been officially submitted, but is apparently helping the US deal with the events. Still, the crucial question why the White House didn't act on its in-house information prior to the crisis in the Middle East remains unclear. While the Presidential Study Directive was conducted in secret, the Obama administration also was repeatedly alerted publicly to the dangerous situation in the Middle East, particularly in Egypt. A high-level Working Group on Egypt, consisting of a bipartisan cadre of former government officials, human rights activists and Middle East experts, sent numerous letters to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in spring of last year repeatedly urging the administration to press for serious reforms in Egypt to avert a possible conflict. The heads of the Working Group on Egypt, Michele Dunne and Robert Kagan, then followed up with an op-ed in the Washington Post in June 2010, warning that \"the Obama administration, in pursuit of an illusory stability, stands mute and passive as the predictable train wreck draws nearer.\" And according to the Washington Post, the group also had meetings with senior State Department officials. So why did the administration not heed the advice of the experts? \"I think they didn't share the urgency that some of us on the outside felt about this,\" Michele Dunne, a co-chair of the Working Group on Egypt told Deutsche Welle. \"That things in Egypt were deteriorating dangerously, that there could be an explosion at some point if Mubarak didn't undertake some reform measures.\" Conflicting positions Dunne, who is a Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington and editor of the online journal the Arab Reform Bulletin, thinks the US administration was in two minds about what to do in Egypt. While Washington saw the situation in Egypt deteriorating after the renewal of the state of emergency and the rigged election, it found it difficult to act upon it, adds Dunne. \"The United States government has a lot of interests to work with Egypt and I think they weren't really sure how to press strongly for improvements for human rights and democracy while at the same time working with the Egyptian government on diplomacy, security, and counterterrorism.\" What's more, many experts, not just those inside the Obama administration, simply underestimated the potential for revolt in Egypt. \"I think that most analysts didn't take seriously trends and developments that we saw in Egypt over the last few years,\" argues Dunne. To her the youth bulge in the country coupled with a high level of unemployment and increased political activism over the Internet was an alarm signal. Real revolution But others didn't think so. \"This was seen as just a virtual political activism, not real political activism and I think the link that most analysts missed was the possibility that these activists who were organizing by the tens of thousands on the Internet could actually take it to the streets,\" says Dunne who emphasizes that she doesn't want to claim that she predicted the revolution would occur when it did, because she didn't. \"However, I did see this year as being a very volatile time in Egypt because of the succession issue,\" she notes. \"Because President Mubarak is 83 years old everyone knew he wouldn't be in the presidency much longer.\" Over in Israel, Tamir Sheafer, an associate professor of political science and communication at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, was also not terribly surprised by the uprising in Egypt. Democratic gap Since 2008 Sheafer and a colleague have been working on a major study on political instability that will be published in the coming months. Their goal: Predicting a country's potential for political instability. To do that, they analyzed 90 countries looking at the usual publicly available variables such as political diversity and income distribution. But then they added a twist to their approach that makes their analysis unique. They created a variable they call the democratic gap. \"This democratic gap is the difference between the democratic values of the people and the level of democracy that is provided to them by the political system,\" explains Sheafer. \"So if for instance people are holding high democratic values but they live in a dictatorship we have a large negative democratic gap. While if the people don't want much democracy, but live in a democracy we have a positive democratic gap, i.e. they are getting more democracy than they want.\" Their major finding is that in countries that have a negative democratic gap there is more political instability. \"This is not a big surprise,\" admits Sheafer freely. \"It just makes sense. The unique thing about our study is that we have managed to measure it.\" Ripe for unrest You can probably guess now which country ranked among those with the highest negative democratic gap. \"In Egypt we see one of the largest democratic gaps among all 90 countries which means that in 2008 our measures show that the difference between the democratic values of the people and the level of democracy that they were given by the political regime was very large,\" says Sheafer. Besides Egypt the three other countries with the largest democratic gap are Iran, Thailand and China, says Sheafer. Among those Iran displays the biggest discrepancy between the democratic aspirations of its people and the level of democracy granted by the regime. While Sheafer repeatedly stresses that the democratic gap method can't predict unrest in a country, it certainly does serve as an indicator that the climate is ripe for political unrest. \"We do see that in those countries where the negative democratic gap is the largest - Iran, Thailand, China and Egypt - after 2008 in three of them except China we experienced extreme phases of instability and violence,\" says Sheafer. As to the vulnerability of other regimes in the Middle East, Sheafer says while they don't have data on Libya, Yemen and Bahrain, Jordan actually has a positive democratic gap and thus according to their data would appear to be less prone to unrest. However two other countries to look out for in the region are Saudi Arabia and Morocco, adds Sheafer. Both have a clear negative democratic gap. Author: Michael Knigge Editor: Rob Mudge",

    "story": "Max Meyer to leave Schalke on a free in summer? Leon Goretzka is already on his way to Bayern Munich and now another Schalke star might be leaving for nothing in the off-season. Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season. Read more: Leon Goretzka to join Bayern Munich in the summer 'We're still ready to talk' Under new coach Domenico Tedesco, Meyer has reclaimed a regular spot in the Schalke XI, moving to a new and more defensive role in midfield. Schalke offered improved terms in light of this development on the pitch. Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?' Because one thing's clear: Max wants to play, and he needs to play.\" Schalke are already preparing for the departure of one of German football's brightest young stars, midfield all-rounder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the season's end.

    "story": "Hurricane Irma thrashes Caribbean as Jose strengthens in wake Hurricane Irma has continued to pack 300 kph winds as it moves across the Caribbean toward Florida. The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety ... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,\" Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? \"I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe,\" he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of \"absolutely historic destructive potential.\" Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula. 'Major hurricane' Irma will have a \"truly devastating\" impact on the state's southern coastal areas when it slams into Florida, said US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) chief Brock Long. Read more: Is climate change making mega-hurricanes the new normal? \"Bottom line is the majority of people along the coast have never experienced a major hurricane like this. It will be truly devastating,\" Long told CNN. \"The entire southeastern United States better wake up and pay attention. Death and destruction At least 11 people have been killed and dozens more injured after Irma tore through the French Caribbean, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament. Thousands displaced Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said nearly every building on Barbuda was damaged when the hurricane's core crossed almost directly over the island early Wednesday and about 60 percent of the island's roughly 1,400 people were homeless.

French, British and Dutch military authorities reportedly rushed aid to the devastated Caribbean islands later on Thursday, with warships and planes dispatching food, water and troops. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said four people were confirmed dead and about 50 injured on the French side of St. Martin, an island split between Dutch and French control. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said 100,000 food rations were sent to St. Barts and St. Martin, the equivalent of four days of supplies. ls/jm (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

    "story": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",

    "story": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",

    "story": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. dm,mm,es/kl (AP, Reuters)",

    "story": "Buchenwald: Lessons from past and present 75 years ago in July, 1937, the concentration camp Buchenwald was built near the city of Weimar. The memorial there today draws people from around the world, and its program has seen some shifts in recent years. Once a favorite area for hiking and vacationing, Buchenwald was transformed in 1937 into a site designed to annihilate people. Beyond clusters of trees, a valley opens up, dotted today by one or two villages. Back then, the cold and windy north side of the valley was set aside for Buchenwald's prisoners, and the more comfortable climate on the southern side was reserved for the guards and camp directors. An open secret \"The camp was no secret,\" noted historian Ronald Hirte during a visit to the grounds. Everyone could have seen Buchenwald from below, he said, because the surrounding forest was not as thick as it is today. Buchenwald was situated about five kilometers (3 miles) from the city of Weimar. Among local residents, its existence was an uncomfortable fact. The concentration camp was a place of horrors that people in the cultural and political focal point of Weimar wanted to know nothing about. \"But many local companies did very well thanks to the work of the prisoners,\" Hirte said. Thousands of people from throughout Europe were deported to the camp beginning in 1937, and they were forced to march from Weimar to Buchenwald. Later the city was connected with the camp by a railway built by the prisoners, who also built a service road still called today by its original name: Blutstra\u00dfe - literally, Blood Street.On a now barren and empty spot on the hill, prisoners had to gather each morning and night for a role call that could last hours. A gateway bearing the words \"Jedem das Seine\" (Translated literally: \"To each his own,\" but figuratively: \"Everyone will get what he deserves.\") still stands, along with bunkers and the dark and musty rooms in which Nazi guards tortured and murdered the prisoners. Bringing the present into focus It is not uncommon for 20 groups of young people to visit the memorial on a given day. \"Interest continues to grow, and so does the number of visitors,\" said Hirte. It is now Germany's third and fourth post-war generations that can come to ask questions here and learn what happened. The memorial offers a wide-ranging educational program. But the point is not to moralize and point fingers into the past, said the director of the memorial, Volkhard Knigge: \"We want to direct questions of contemporary society toward the past.\" More concretely, that means that issues including human rights violations, persecution, right-wing extremism and nationalism are taken up as contemporary topics against the historical background of the Holocaust. \"Today, that is our central historical, political, and ethical educational task,\" Knigge said. During a recent visit, two 14-year-old boys sat in front of a plaque listing the home countries of former prisoners. \"We are here with our school, and our teacher just showed us around. Now we have a couple of assignments to do - for example, finding out where the prisoners were from and how many lived here,\" one boy explained. Watching them, it is apparent that this is not just a routine field trip. There is a bit of horsing around when the school groups first arrive, but silence and solemnity are the norm once students pass by the execution chambers and furnaces used to incinerate bodies. There are also groups from Poland, Russia and the USA in attendance. One American student relates that her grandfather was among those who helped liberate Buchenwald but that he never spoke about the experience. No \"trite effects\" Addressing questions about what should be shown today, how the site should be commentated, what is authentic and credible - and what isn't - forms the core of the work done by the memorial's team. The administration has generally tried to avoid reconstructing what Buchenwald might have been like. \"We don't want to create any trite effects,\" said Ronald Hirte. \"The noisiness and narrowness of this place, how terrible the smell was - we could never convey that to visitors today anyway.\" The memorial's head said that Buchenwald has become a model for other countries around the world - in a partnership sense rather than in a presumptuous way. \"Everywhere in the world, in South America, Rwanda, South Africa, Hungary, in the former Yugoslavia, there are people examining and dealing with their history. We support and encourage them in their search for ways to honor and respect victims without concealing the horrors of what happened,\" he said. Asking why In recent years, other less visible groups have been added to the list of those memorialized. Alongside Jewish victims, politically persecuted individuals of various nationalities, Soviet prisoners of war and Roma and Sinti people, the grounds now also house memorials to German Armed Forces deserters, homosexuals and Jehovah's Witnesses.The varied exhibitions allow visitors to learn more about Buchenwald, including the fact that it was changed into a Soviet camp just after the war. Just a few traces are left over from this chapter in Buchenwald's history. The camp was used to imprison those whom the Soviets suspected of having supported the Nazi regime. Even when their suspicions proved unfounded, it played no role. Being suspect was enough to justify a multi-year sentence. This part of Buchenwald's history became taboo during the GDR period. Thousands of people who died of hunger and disease between 1945 and 1950 lie today in mass graves that have been converted into cemetaries. Buchenwald has become a double memorial.

    "story": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

    "story": "Secretary of State John Kerry due in Cairo as Gaza death toll mounts US Secretary of State John Kerry is due in Cairo to push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas as the death toll in Gaza surpasses 500. Israel's army said several militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. \"We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza,\" spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement. Late Sunday, the United Nations Security Council in New York held urgent talks on the conflict, and expressed \"serious concern about the growing numbers of casualties.\" \"The members of the Security Council call for an immediate cessation of hostilities,\" said Rwandan ambassador Eugene Richard Gasana, whose country currently chairs the 15-member council. hc/dr (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)",

    "story": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",

    "story": "Libya factions declare ceasefire After two days of peace talks in Geneva, a tentative ceasefire has been called in the restive North African country. Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

    "story": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",

    "story": "Keeping cool on Europe's urban heat islands Due to the drought in Europe, Austria experienced a particularly hot summer this year. Urban areas run warmer due to the heat island effect - and as the climate heats up, cities like Vienna are tackling this problem. Europe was hit by drought this summer, with parts of the continent experiencing the longest and hottest heat waves on record. In the Austrian capital of Vienna, temperatures were well above the summer average - and stayed there for weeks on end. This summer, the city recorded the most days over 35 degrees Celsius - including its hottest-ever night temperature - and medical calls rose by 20 percent. Environmental health specialist Hans-Peter Hutter says that on particularly calm, hot days, recommended public health limits for ozone were are significantly exceeded. And it's not just people with allergies and other conditions who suffer. \"We know that in these acute periods, unfortunately, people will die,\" he says. The heat is becoming such an issue that the government has resolved to tackle what is known as the urban heat island effect. Like most cities, Vienna is hotter than its surrounding areas as a result of humans having altered the landscape, covering the earth with heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete. The phenomenon was first described more than two centuries ago - but global warming and industrialization are pushing it to new extremes. \"The densely built-up parts of the city can be 4, 5, up to 10 degrees [Celsius] warmer than the surroundings,\" says Christian H\u00e4rtel, an expert in building and planning who is researching this effect and its causes for Vienna's environmental protection department. More green roofs, less air-con There are many reasons for the dramatic temperature differentials between city and countryside. Fresh air and wind don't circulate as freely through cities. Colors and materials play a role too, with dark surfaces absorbing more heat than lighter ones. And due to the sealing over of soils, urban landscapes retain less moisture than natural ones. Up on the roof terrace of the city block where he works, H\u00e4rtel points to two different roof types. \"One is a pebble roof - when the sun shines it gets very hot,\" H\u00e4rtel says. \"On the other there is a colorful garden with a variety of herbs - I can see mint and over there, sage, chives, we have a water surface and a terraced area. It's a garden in the city,\" he points out. Vienna's city administration wants many more green roofs on buildings and residential blocks. As global temperatures rise, says H\u00e4rtel, the need for natural methods to keep cities cool is becoming more urgent. Otherwise, artificial methods result in a negative feedback effect. \"It's getting hotter, and so we cool our living spaces by consuming fossil fuels - and so we are then making this hothouse effect even worse,\" H\u00e4rtel explains. Pocket parks Vienna's imperial past has left a legacy of grand parks and open spaces. Once, only royalty could kick up their heels in these pleasant grounds. But now, they provide a welcome haven for all the city's residents to literally chill out when temperatures rise. \"Vienna has had luck with the empire times, because these places became protected,\" says Mia Landauer as she strolls through one such grand park beside her office at the Institute for Applied Systems Analysis to the south of Vienna, where she works as a research scholar on climate governance. The city is also fringed by the Vienna Woods on its northern side. Landauer sees this as an asset that mitigates the urban heat island effect. \u201cWe might have lost the Vienna Woods many times - but because of this history of Vienna, they realized that it is important to have this much green space in a city.\" Like in most cities, Vienna's population is growing rapidly, driven partly by immigration and partly by lack of jobs in rural areas. So does that mean the urban island will become even hotter as the city grows? Landauer says this need not be the case - but \"the pressure is on\" because of climate change. That pressure comes from the conflict between the need for green spaces, and the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing commuting distances through more dense urban living. Landauer believes \"pocket parks\" could provide a solution. \"That means parks like any park, but of a very small size,\" she says. It's been demonstrated that in dense urban environments, even small parks can reduce the urban heat island effect. Landauer says these tiny green spaces also reduce flooding by absorbing water, and preventing the overflow of drains and sewers. Not to mention added benefits in terms of quality of life and enjoyment for residents with access to these parks. Cool cities make the most of rainwater While new buildings can be designed with green walls and roofs, it's more difficult to reduce heat in older areas of the city. In Vienna's 5th district most buildings are at least 100 years old, and there are few parks. But a new system could use rainwater to cool this dense urban environment. H\u00e4rtner explains how the city is attempting to collect the water that falls on the street. \"Instead of allowing it to run into the sewers and drains, we will store it and allow it to evaporate,\" he says. Parks can also act as water storage areas, where the water can be diverted into a temporary pool or wetland to slowly evaporate, cooling the urban air. Vienna will launch its strategy to combat the urban heat island effect this autumn. Along with catching, storing and allowing rainwater to evaporate, it will require new buildings have more green space, and encourage residents in rooftop apartments to start planting. After the hottest summer on record, the plans should get a warm reception.",

    "story": "Syria's Christians flee rebel crosshairs Groups of Jihadists are increasingly targeting Christian communities, lumping them together as \"pro Assad.\" More than a third of Christians have fled. Some worry about the future of Christianity in the country. In the days after a sharpshooter put his brother in the crosshairs and pulled the trigger, Jalal Gazouha lived as if in a cloud. \"I almost went crazy with grief,\" the Syrian explained on the telephone. The connection crackles. The 29-year-old's brother was killed by al Qaeda fighters in the western Syrian city of al-Qusayr, close to the Lebanese border. Gazouha is convinced that his brother was killed because he was Christian. \"They want to drive us out of Syria,\" he told DW. By \"they,\" he's referring to Jihadists from countries neighboring Syria - with a few hundred from Germany mixed in - who have joined in the Syrian civil war to fight against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. According to Gazouha, they're also targeting Christians. Twenty of his family members have been murdered, he says. When Gazouha received death threats, he fled the country. \"I saw my name on a list on the Internet. That list contained names of Christians who were supposed to be killed, he says, written by \"the terrorists of al Qaeda.\" Jean Kawak, a Syriac bishop from Damascus, chose his words carefully when he spoke about the subject with DW. \"We Christians have recently felt threatened by particular radical Islamist groups,\" he said. Kawak's own sister was forced to flee Ma'loula, a small, largely Christian village just an hour's drive north of Damascus. Islamist rebel groups attacked that village, carried out fire attacks on two churches in Rakka in north central Syria and also kidnapped two Syrian bishops in April; the culprits behind the latter attack, eyewitnesses said, were foreign Jihadists. All of these things, the Aramaic bishop says, \"affect our Christian presence within Syria.\" One-third of Christians have fled the country in the last two years due to the civil war - with numbers increasing. These radicalized groups are not only targeting Christians though, Kawak says. \"Moderate Muslims are also being threatened.\" Fears of displacement Kawak fears that Christian refugees may not be able to return at war's end - something comparable, he says, to what happened in southern Turkey. \"Christianity has been there for 2,000 years. And we hope that Christianity is not going to leave that area.\" To prevent that, Kawak traveled from Damascus to Europe for a short trip. He met with Swedish politicians, German aid organization employees as well as members of Germany's Foreign Office, showing statistics related to refugees and handing out so many business cards that he had none left by the time of the interview with DW. His goal? More humanitarian aid for people in Syria - but also a political solution to the conflict. The West must do more, he says, to bring both sides to the negotiating table. \"Reconciliation is possible,\" says Kawak - of that he is convinced. But what kind of reconciliation could be possible between Bashar al-Assad and the rebels, the latter of whom have rejected any form of political solution that leaves Assad in power? The bishop shakes his head. \"You can't make demands before you begin negotiations. A real dialogue has to take place without preconditions,\" he said. Otherwise, the bishop worries, murders and tit-for-tat attacks will continue for years - perhaps decades - with an unforeseeable end for Syria's Christians. Praying for peace Jochen Langer, Middle East expert at the International Society for Human Rights, shares the bishop's concerns. \"The Syrian army is trying, as well as they can, to protect Syria's Christians,\" he told DW. \"But that's only possible to a limited extent.\" Lately, the regime has been hard-pressed to secure any single area within Syria. Daily, sometimes hourly, the fronts between rebel forces and the Syrian army change. Christians are in particular danger, Langer says, \"when they, wherever they live, end up between the fighting.\" In other words, Christians, like all Syrians, die from the bombs and grenades that land in their villages and cities. In some regions, Langer says, Christians have already been singled out, often by the Islamist al-Nusra Front, a group moderate opposition forces have no control over. But the expert also added that \"those could also be very personal acts of rage.\" Sadiq Al-Mousslie, a member of the Syrian National Council in Germany that forms part of the Syrian National Coalition, acknowledges that there were cases of \"sporadic attacks by sick individuals.\" But were they targeted attacks? \"No,\" he says firmly. \"That's part of the Assad regime's propaganda that's been taken up by the West.\" Behind it, he says, is the regime's intent to divide and weaken the opposition. For Jalal Gazouhas and his Christian family, other factors also had an influence. His extended family's homes and property holdings were divided amongst his Muslim neighbors, he says. \"We were an important family in al-Qusayr. That's why we were attacked.\" Still, he is convinced: \"We were persecuted because we're Christians.\" He speaks of friends who disappeared without a trace, rumors of checkpoints where Syrians with Christian names are arrested. Previously, Gazouha worked for Syria's ministry of tourism. Today, he's \"not with Assad, but for the regime.\" Why? \"Under Assad there was security for Christians,\" he says. Christians in Syria are often therefore accused of supporting the Assad regime - or remaining neutral at the very least and of not having joined the opposition forces. It's an accusation Bishop Jean Kawak rejects. \"The whole world puts Christians in one basket - pro regime - and this is not true,\" he says. Like all other communities, there are Christians in Syria who support Assad, those who are against him and those in the middle.

    "story": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",

    "story": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",

    "story": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

    "story": "Belarusian president accuses Germany, Poland of coup plans Before being sworn in for a fourth term, the reclusive leader of Belarus fired a warning salvo at the European Union, accusing Germany and Poland of plotting a coup and threatening action against sanctions. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

    "story": "Indian government tells Supreme Court Rohingya pose 'serious threat' After an appeal from two Rohingya, India's top court is considering PM Narendra Modi's plan to deport some 40,000 Rohingya in India. The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence. Read more: Rohingya people in Myanmar \u2013 What you need to know The ongoing violence follows an insurgent attack on security forces on August 25 in Rakhine state that sparked off a brutal military counteroffensive. Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",

    "story": "Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Cyclist Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from cycling for life, in a much-anticipated ruling by the sport's international governing body. Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",

    "story": "US Supreme Court Justice Scalia dies at 79, setting off succession showdown Justice Antonin Scalia, an outspoken conservative and the longest-serving member of the US' top court, has passed away in Texas. President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote.

    "story": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",

    "story": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",

    "story": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"But then I think of all the people who've misused this event - and I decide to come.\" She smiled.",

    "story": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",

    "story": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",

    "story": "How to wrap a present without using paper or tape Next time you get invited to a birthday party, you could try wrapping the present using a piece of fabric and ribbon. It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",

    "story": "European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",

    "story": "Bayern Munich coast to win over Nuremberg Bayern Munich wrapped up the 12th Bundesliga match day with an easy win over Nuremberg. Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively. Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg. Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",

    "story": "Slovaks accused of spying in Iran released Six Slovak paragliders detained in Iran since May on suspicion of spying have been released. They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",

    "story": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",

    "story": "German Interior Ministry Claims Progress on Crime Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble released his department's official statistics concerning crime in 2006 in Berlin on Tuesday. And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",

    "story": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

    "story": "Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella to face Vatican trial for child pornography  A Catholic diplomat was recalled from the Washington embassy despite US requests to charge him in the country. He allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography. A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks. Read more: Australian archbishop becomes most senior cleric convicted of hiding abuse Diplomatic immunity The monsignor was recalled from the Washington embassy after US authorities alerted the Vatican to his alleged crimes and requested his diplomatic immunity be stripped. The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s.

    "story": "Russia to create corporate aid fund, tapping pensions Moscow is planning to set up an emergency fund to help companies hit by sanctions imposed on Russian firms over the country's role in the Ukraine crisis. The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",

    "story": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",

    "story": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but 'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but 'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",

    "story": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

    "story": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",

    "story": "No more 'veggie sausages?' Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015.

    "story": "Trudeau declares victory in Canada as Harper resigns Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party has been elected Canada's new prime minister. Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

    "story": "Unilateral Saudi cease-fire in Yemen to begin on May 12 Saudi Arabia has announced a five-day humanitarian cease-fire in Yemen starting from next Tuesday. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has urged all parties to find a political solution to the conflict. \"We have made a decision that the cease-fire will begin this Tuesday, May 12, at 11.00 pm and will last for five days subject to renewal if it works out,\" Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a meeting of Gulf ministers in Paris on Friday alongside US Secretary of State John Kerry. The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would \"come to their senses\" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a \"military target,\" giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",

    "story": "Ukraine: \"Chocolate King\" Petro Poroshenko wins presidential election, according to exit polls Early results from Ukraine's presidential poll indicate that Petro Poroshenko has won the absolute majority of the votes. He said that his victory meant voters had chosed the path of \"European Integration.\" Exit polls gave Petro Poroshenko, a 48-year-old billionaire and owner of a chocolate factory, between 55.9 and 57.3 percent of the vote. This put him well ahead of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was reported to have come in second, at 12.9 percent. Andrij Shevchenko, one of Tymoshenko's political allies, said on Twitter that she had conceded defeat. DW's reporter Kitty Logan in Kyiv said voter turnout was extremely high in the capital. Most polling stations in the east of the country remained closed on Sunday. If the figures are confirmed, there will not be a need for a runoff on June 15. Poroshenko, who has promised closer economic and political ties with the West, has also vowed to mend relations with Russia, but insisted that Ukraine's territorial integrity was of top importance to him. In his first statements following the publication of the early results, Poroshenko announced he would travel to the east of the country quickly. He also announced that parliamentary elections would be held later this year. rg/lw (Reuters, dpa)",

    "story": "#BringBackOurGirls still hopeful one year on One year ago, more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants. Parents of the missing girls told DW's correspondent in Nigeria, Adrian Kriesch, that they remain optimistic. Lawal Emos clenches his fist and kneads his fingers. He had firmly resolved not to cry when he talks about Comfort. She is a lovely girl, Emos says, always helpful and determined. Comfort is his 17-year-old daughter. A year ago she was abducted by Boko Haram from their school in the village of Chibok, northeastern Nigeria. Like other tens of thousands, Emos, his wife and their five remaining children fled to Yola, a city located 270 kilometers (167 miles) from Chibok. He has gotten thinner in recent months as his family survives on irregular donations from friends and the Red Cross. Formerly a farmer in his home town, Emos has been unable to get land in Yola. \"Do you have a photo of Comfort?\" I ask. And immediately the father of six breaks down in tears. Emos admits that he can't control his emotions whenever he sees his daughter's picture. He left all of them in Chibok. Opening wounds This is the third time I am in Yola since the kidnapping of the Chibok girls on the night of April 14 -15, 2014. It is also the third time while covering for DW the plight of the girls still in Boko Haram captivity. As emotional wounds of the parents are ripped open once again, tears flow, I film, and I get this bad feeling. Lawal Emos says he knows of twelve fellow parents who have died following the kidnapping. \"The constant crying and thinking of their daughters killed them.\" Emos and his wife Hauwa sometimes find themselves thinking that it would be easier for them if they knew their daughter was dead. \"I have lost my hope in politicians because they are not doing anything,\" Hauwa says. \"Only God can still help us to find them - dead or alive. But our government, forget it.\" Three weeks after the abduction, the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram claimed responsibility. For six years, the Islamic sect has carried out a deadly insurgency especially in northeastern Nigeria. Initially, Boko Haram said it was fighting against the corrupt Nigerian government, but with time its objectives have become increasingly unclear. Thousands of Christians and Muslims have been killed in raids and attacks by the militants. As for the kidnapped girls, Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau said in one of his bizarre speeches, they had been sold off as slaves. Government's inconsistency An international outcry for the Chibok girls became a phenomenon with the hashtag #bringbackourgirls on Twitter. Nigeria's neighbors declared war on Boko Haram and the US sent military advisers to help locate and free the girls. On May 26, 2014, Alex Badeh, Nigeria's supreme commander of the armed forces, proclaimed that they knew the whereabouts of the girls but a rescue operation would be too dangerous. In mid-October last year, army chief Badeh went before the press again saying an armistice had been signed and that the girls will be freed. It turned out to be another lie. It took outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan and his wife three months before meeting with the parents of the girls for the first time. \"He said, 'Within three weeks, you will all have your daughters back, and within three weeks, we will renovate all destroyed schools in the region,'\" recalls Lawal Emos. \"Three weeks passed, then several months and nothing happened.\" Meanwhile Boko Haram continued their attacks on villagers unabated. Will Chibok girls ever be found? Shortly before Nigerians went to the polls on March 28, the Nigerian military together with neighboring countries of Chad, Cameroon and Niger began an offensive to drive out Boko Haram from occupied territories. Many Nigerians believe the timing of the offensive in the middle of the election campaign is not entirely coincidental. \"The confidence in the military is at its lowest ebb,\" says journalist Umar Faruq Baba Inna from Yola. The outcry on the internet for the release of the Chibok girls has gotten quieter, only a few activists are now seen protesting on Nigerian streets. Many observers believe that senior military officials have no interest in ending the insurgency because of the benefits from the massive security budget. \"The incoming administration of Muhammadu Buhari has a lot to do to reassure the citizenry that we can trust government and the armed forces,\" Baba Inna says. Buhari's opposition APC party won a resounding victory in the northeast, where the conflict rages. Even Lawal Emos voted for the former general, who has promised to crush Boko Haram in just six months. However, Nigerian political analyst Edgar Amos doubts if Buhari will ever find the Chibok girls. \"A whole year has passed and they are in the hands of heartless, brutal terrorists who commit atrocities against the innocent. Realistically, it is hard to claim that we will find all the girls healthy and alive.\" \"Thank you for reporting about our daughters once again,\" Lawal Emos says as we come to a close. \"It means a lot to us, we must not forget the girls.\" I am relieved because Emos does not blame me for opening the wounds.

    "story": "Ex-Euro Olympic boss Hickey released on bail in Brazil The former European Olympic Committee president Patrick Hickey - awaiting trial over an alleged ticketing scam - has been released on bail in Rio. The 71-year old can now leave the country for medical treatment. Brazilian judge Juliana Leal de Melo - who serves on a court overseeing amateur and professional sports - authorized the release of Hickey's passport upon payment of 1.5 million real ($435,000) bail. Hickey could now have medical treatment, the Rio state court system said in a statement. Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight \"each and every one\u201d of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces. Hickey, who was also the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland, was released from custody last month, but must remain in Brazil until the case is heard. \"For clarity, I am not under house arrest as, like with so many things with this case, has been misreported by the media,\u201d Hickey said in a statement on Monday. Hickey was arrested on 10 August at a luxury beachfront hotel during the games. The authorities told Reuters last week that they believe the ring had operated for around eight years and was preparing for other Olympic events such as the 2020 Tokyo Games. jbh/bw (AP, AFP)",

    "story": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to the West The La Belle disco bombing in Berlin on April 5, 1986 was ruled to be Libya's doing. Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",

    "story": "Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",

    "story": "Top NATO commander says Ukraine ceasefire is 'in name only' NATO's top military commander has called the truce between Ukraine's military and pro-Russia separatists a 'ceasefire in name only.' US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas. While neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of NATO, both share borders with NATO countries. se/ksb (AP, AFP)",

    "story": "German FA calls off matches with China under-20 team after protests Germany's football association has called off several friendly matches between China's under-20 team and German lower league sides. The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs \u2013 TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of \u20ac15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game \u2013 the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",

    "story": "For drivers in Germany, 2010 was the most expensive year ever Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds",

    "story": "Rohail Aslam: Translating Business Knowledge into Practice After finishing his Bachelors of Business Administration in the United Kingdom, Rohail Aslam went back to his home country, India. But he was eager to spend more time abroad and this time he chose Germany. His host country has thrown many challenges at him but he's been here for over five years. Small-built, smiling and very gentle, Rohail explains why he stayed. DW-WORLD: Why did you choose Germany in the first place? Rohail Aslam: I already knew a little bit of German, and I joined the Goethe Institute (Max Mueller Bhavan) in New Delhi to fine-tune it. After almost a year in Delhi, I finally landed in Germany to do an MBA at the \u2018Fachhochschule f\u00fcr Technik und Wirtschaft\u2019 in Berlin. What made you stay for so long? It was pretty much understood that after I had graduated, I would stay back for a while to gather some knowledge of the country, the country\u2019s business structure and the working culture. I also had the intention of doing an internship here and getting a job to gain some experience here. My family has a carpet manufacturing company back in India. My parents wanted to expand it and start exporting abroad. So, while I was studying, they set up a company in Bad Oeynhausen in north-west Germany. We've been actively exporting rugs to Germany, Western Europe and the US for four years. What could be better than giving my knowledge and expertise to my parents and to their company instead of offering those services to someone else? Does the manufacturing process also take place in Germany? No, everything happens in India -- in Bhadohi in Uttar-Pradesh, which is a renowned carpet-belt -- and the services are much cheaper there. Once the product is completed, it's exported to Germany in huge quantities. Who designs the rugs? Designing is a two-way process. Either we pick our own designs and work on them -- we have two specialised designers who work for us. But if clients come to us with certain designs, colours and patterns then we make the rugs according to their requirements. Where is your company based? We have two companies which are both owned by my mother. The parent company is the manufacturing unit based in India -- called \u2018Rohail Teppich Export\u2019 - and the daughter company exports from Germany and is called \u2018Handel Kontor\u2019. So we sit here in Germany communicating with our clients, showing them our new products, introducing new colours and designs, inviting them to visit our showroom in Germany in case they cannot visit India. Do your carpets have a lot of Indian colours or designs? Well, I would not exactly classify them as Indian designs or colours. It's more about the trend of the market -- this could be anything. If it's called \u2018Indian\u2019, then it is. But the only justification for calling our carpets Indian is that they are manufactured in India. Unless, of course, somebody wants a carpet which has an Indian palace in its design. Otherwise, we mostly have modern and abstract designs -- for example, a bunch of boxes and dices. What is the market in Germany like compared to that of other European countries or the United States? The market is, of course, better in the comparatively colder countries. Having said that, conditions in Spain and in Portugal have actually been booming in the last decade or so. But overall the market is slow at the moment because the entire purchasing and selling pattern has changed. For example, 15 or 20 years ago a carpet or rug was almost a status symbol -- it was valuable. Now rugs are available everywhere. Not only that, earlier a rug meant handmade work and precision work by hand. But now you have machines, even robots, making rugs. Are your carpets also machine-made? The rugs we have are entirely hand-made. We have no machine work anywhere in our enterprise -- we don't have a production plant as such. The entire work process, from \u2018start\u2019 to \u2018finish\u2019, of a rug is entirely hand-made. Was it very difficult to start up a company in Germany? In fact no. Some might say it was as easy as child-play -- there were very little bureaucracy or paper-work. The whole company had been set up within a couple of hours. So, the set-up procedure is simple. But how easy is it to keep the business going? Well, that's the challenge. Because here there are not only other Indians who have stalls, shops or companies, there are also Persians, Turks, Moroccans, Germans, and English people. So there is a lot of competition. And the guarantee for success is dependent on the amount of effort and, more importantly, on market support. How do you cope with this kind of competition? It's hard. It's very hard. It's like an uphill struggle everyday. There are moments of doubt and dejection but they can come no matter what field one is in. And, of course, when the rewards come they are very satisfying and gratifying. I am positive because I have no other choice. What is your goal after being in Germany for five years? Since the enterprise has already been set up, our goal is first to make sure that people will recognise our products, recognise us as a unit, and respect us for our quality, designs and colours. Which, of course, means that they should respect and enjoy our products because of the difficulty of producing A-quality rugs. Secondly, through our rugs we want to build goodwill. We want people to recognise our company name. Did you face any problems being a South Asian while struggling to establish yourself and your company? I faced the usual business related problems because there is at least 10 times more supply than there is demand but this is true not only for the rug trade but for any trade. It's difficult to establish your own two feet in a place where people have already established relationships 20 or 30 years ago and are constantly working with their partners in India, China, Pakistan, Morocco etc. And for us it was more difficult because we had had a partnership with a German company before establishing our own company but the company had unfortunately gone bankrupt. So we had to re-start the entire process and re-establish relations. At present, we do not have any fixed partners - we work with companies or clients who are willing to work with us. Our most recent target countries are in the new Eastern bloc -- namely Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. We also have contacts in the Baltic states, Iceland and Scandinavia. Of course, we also have clients all over Germany. What do you miss most about India? Actually I was able to go home only four years after I came to Germany. The first one and a half years I was studying and that did not allow me any break. Then, while I was finishing my studies, my parents established our company here. After my studies, I jumped straight into the business. At that time, I missed home very much. In comparison to the United Kingdom, there are far fewer Indian or Pakistani restaurants here in Germany. Four years ago, it was difficult even difficult to find an Indian grocery here. I missed home-food the most. Now that has become easier. But even now, there is hardly anything where I live. So I cook for myself. Besides food, I also miss the kind of sports which I used to enjoy back home, namely hockey and cricket.",

    "story": "Spain takes in first of five Guantanamo detainees The first of five Guantanamo inmates slated to be taken in by Spain has arrived there. The move shows Madrid's support of US efforts to close the controversial prison. Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian. The new arrival will be able to work and move around Spain as he wishes, but will not be able to leave the country. \"He is a Palestinian, he has already arrived in our country. We do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally,\" he told a news conference. Spain urges others to 'do the utmost' Spain's decision to take five Guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help US President Barack Obama with his plans to shut down the jail. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries \"to do their utmost\" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet. Some 200 detainees remain there, but finding places to take in the prisoners - even the dozens already cleared for release - has proved controversial. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer",

    "story": "Opinion: A decision against heart and mind The House of Commons has passed the Brexit bill - despite most parliamentarians being against it. But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread will stay open for 24 hours after publication.",

    "story": "'The term Islamist doesn't mean anything anymore' Not since 1989 has a whole region undergone democratic revolution, but what are the common denominators in the Arab Spring? DW asked Lebanese lecturer and activist Ziad Majed, and he gave some surprising answers. Ziad Majed is a lecturer in political science at the American University in Paris. In 2004, he co-founded the Democratic Left Movement and participated in the Lebanese uprising of 2005 against the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. In 2009 he joined the Beirut Spring Forum. Deutsche Welle: We hear a lot about the relatively young age of populations in the countries that have overthrown rulers this year. But your take on that is somewhat different, isn't it? Ziad Majed: The demographic boom that we had in the past was over a few years ago, but the product of this boom is there, and it was young people taking to the streets now. However, the birth rate of this generation is much lower than that of its parents. That means at the age of 25 or 26, when their parents had two or three or four children, they don't have any kids. That makes them more capable of being mobilized. In addition, the fact that the age of marriage, whether for economic reasons or changing values, is becoming higher allowed them to take to the streets. This explains why the revolutions happened now and not five or 10 years ago. But youth still plays a role. You have to realize that people were simply extremely tired of seeing the same old faces in power who ruled when their parents were young. What I could also add is urbanization. That means territorial and social continuity. Young people are no longer isolated in small villages or small towns. The role of global media feeds into that trend, doesn't it? The first thing is satellite media. Anywhere you go in the Arab world, you'll see small dishes or even illegal satellite TV receptors. So direct governmental censorship and control of the media is no longer an issue. Everyone goes to al-Jazeera or al-Arabiya or even Arabophone European stations. Then, Internet penetration is becoming much higher. People can meet in cyber-caf\u00e9s and discuss what they read. In Egypt, for instance. Khalid Said was a young guy in Alexandria who owned a cyber-caf\u00e9. The police were trying to force him to pay bribes and he refused. He even took pictures with his mobile phone of policemen beating someone. So they kidnapped him, and he was beaten and killed. The anger following his death led to the creation of a facebook page, which was one of the most important sites at the beginning of the revolution. In Syria, what was most important was that every citizen became a reporter. Independent, international media aren't allowed. So the only way for people to cover what's happening is by making mobile-phone images and uploading them to Youtube so the world can witness what's going on. A moderate Islamist party just took the most votes in elections in Tunisia, and the Muslim Brotherhood may emerge as the strongest party in next month's vote in Egypt. How does that square with democracy? The term \"Islamist\" doesn't mean anything anymore. The word arose in the 1980s and 90s to describe the rise of political Islam. Today, there's a whole sprectrum of groups that can be described as Islamist from the Wahabis to the Salafis, the Muslim Brotherhood to Hezbollah and Hamas. All these groups are different and don't agree on a single version of the sharia. The West should understand that under repressive regimes mosques were places of refuge, and that there's a tendency after the fall of a regime to vote for groups representing the victims of that regime. So it's logical that there should be some Islamist parties doing well. But that doesn't mean the same thing it did in the 1980s and 90s, when the movements concentrated on changing regimes by violence or force. For the first time, Islamist movements have achieved power through elections, and that will change them, making them part of the political game. They may win now. But if they don't deliver on problems like unemployment, why would anyone vote for them again? But won't they try to turn back the clock in a lot of ways? They might be very conservative in their mindset, but they cannot impose what they consider to be an Islamization of society. They are not the strongest part of the democratic movement, only the most organized. I'm not scared because I think the Arab Spring is irreversible. People have discovered the power of the street and of mobilization. So if the \"Islamists\" try to impose something on society, what's stopping people from going back out on the street and saying \"We're not happy with this?\" And what can Europe and the West in general do to help ensure that the democratic promise of the Arab Spring becomes a reality? Four things. We need investment that's decentralized so as to bring prosperity to neglected regions and that's guided by a principle of corporate responsibility. We need observers who monitor progress and issue reports on things like women's rights or help train police to act up to Western standards. We need help setting up better electoral systems and reforming the judiciary so that it's independent. And we need help educating people. That's probably most important of all.

    "story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in thalassotherapies and cosmetic treatments. \"It's much like in the beginning,\" B\u00e4tje concludes. For over 200 years later, the holiday-makers have been coming to enjoy the fresh sea air and the healthy bracing climate. Dieter Sell (epd)",

    "story": "Taking stock of press freedom in Germany Fifty years ago, the offices of \"Spiegel\" magazine were searched and leading journalists arrested as a result of political pressure. Press freedom eventually prevailed. Today too the media's independence is under threat. What happened in October, 1962, had a lasting effect on the relationship between politicians, the judiciary and journalists in Germany. Spiegel news magazine had published an article critical of Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr. The German army, it said, was only \"prepared for defense to a limited extent\", adding it would certainly have to employ nuclear missiles to counter attacks. That was the author's conclusion following an evaluation of a NATO maneuver. Leading politicians - first and foremost Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss - accused the magazine of treason. A constitutional lawyer filed charges against the editorial office, arrest warrants were issued for the author and the chief editor. The latter remained in custody for more than 100 days. The Spiegel editorial department was shut down for weeks. There was a public outcry against the state's handling of the journalists, even protest from members of the coalition government. In the end, Defense Minister Strauss was forced to resign after his considerable participation in the reprisals against the news magazine became evident. Germany's Federal Court of Justice also ruled there was no proof of treason. What became known as the Spiegel Affair still touches issues that are highly relevant even today. Is a democratic state allowed to reprimand critical reporters? And how freely can the German media report on politics? Press freedom today \"Such featherbrained attempts by politics to influence the press are today no longer possible,\" Bodo Hombach, former Social Democrat and director of WAZ media group, told Deutsche Welle. The head of the German Federation of Journalists (DJV), Michael Konken agrees. \"We have a critical media with quality publications and broadcasters who bring such problems to the public.\" At the same time, Konken has to admit that Reporters without Borders has in the past years ranked Germany only in places 17 to 19 in its press freedom index. The top places where occupied by the Scandinavian countries. This, Konken said, pointed to problems in Germany. And indeed, there have been examples confirming that in the recent past. Politics has grip on public broadcasters The \"Brender case\" is often viewed as an example of a blow to freedom of the press. Nikolas Brender was editor-in-chief of Germany's public broadcaster ZDF. As he was an independently minded journalist who would not refrain from saying what he thought, he was not always popular with politicians. It was first and foremost Roland Koch, premier of the state of Hesse at the time, who opposed renewing Brender's contract - and Bender lost his job. How was this possible? All public broadcasters are officially controlled by their supervisory and administrative boards. After the experience of government controlled media under the Nazis, broadcasters in post-war West Germany were supposed to be democratically controlled. The boards are made up of a cross-section of society, including politicians from all major parties. In the case of ZDF when Brender was editor in chief, the board was dominated by conservative politicians. And that's what stacked the odds against Bender when it came to extending his contract. Powerless The way in which Brender was treated by the politicians on the board caused an uproar across the entire media landscape in Germany. Even representatives of the conservative media thought that a line had been crossed. \"An act of unbelievable high-handedness\" of those responsible, says Mathias D\u00f6pfner, who is at the helm of the conservative Axel Springer publishing house. \"A dangerous interference with the DNA of a broadcaster,\" criticized Frank Schirmacher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily. But, again and again, there have been attempts - mostly by politicial leaders - to interfere with the internal affairs of a broadcaster; a claim confirmed by Hartmann von der Tann, former coordinator for politics with Germany's other big public broadcaster, ARD. Print media also affected Newspapers in Germany experience limits to press freedom for different reasons. Dirk C. Fleck, for his book \"The Fourth Power,\" spoke to 25 leading journalists and editors-in-chief about how independent they are. There's not a lot of room, he says. Speaking to DW, the author described the sobering answers he got and how almost all of the journalists describe the same vicious circle. It began with the boom of the Internet. More and more people got their news from the Web; in particular, young people who are important for advertising. Many companies therefore shifted their advertising budgets to focus on the Internet. German publishers responded by setting up online newsrooms to get some of the money going into online ads. But the free content offered online has not generated enough revenue through advertising. The print media has failed to capitalize on the online market. With the same budget, publishers have since tried to sustain both their print and online editions. As a result, editorial offices have been split, and more and more work ends up on fewer shoulders. The increase in the workload and the Internet's hunger for new stories within hours, or even minutes, puts enormous pressure on journalists. Proper independent research has become a luxury. Risiko manipulation \"What dominates is content that can quickly be generated,\" says Fleck. It is rare that investigative research really uncovers a political scandal. Instead, there are quick party stories or the quick report on a police patrol catching speeding drivers, he notes. Content is getting shallower and more tabloid-like, while a lack of time and money means journalists follow the herd, he said. For Bodo Hombach it adds up to \"many editors picking up those stories that are already in the news,\" Small regional papers, especially, often take offers from PR firms. What they get are free and perfectly tailored articles, interviews and videos. \"That, too, is a way to lose our press freedom,\" says Michael Konken and confirms that in some cases companies have even withdrawn their ads should a publication write critically about the company. \"This is not the press freedom we have in mind,\" he warned.",

    "story": "Lockdown lifted after active shooter false alarm at Andrews military base outside US capital A false report of an active shooter at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., briefly put the facility on lockdown. The base hosts Air Force One, used by President Obama. An active shooter exercise at Joint Base Andrews was mistaken for a real shooting situation on Thursday morning, triggering a lockdown at the military base that houses the president's aircraft. Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., issued a \"shelter in place\" order after an active shooter incident was reported at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility at approximately 9 am local time. The base said on Twitter that there was an active shooter exercise scheduled, but a real active shooter situation was reported. It later cleared the facility. The lockdown delayed the travel of Vice President Joe Biden, who was scheduled to fly to Ohio for a campaign event. The Joint Base Andrews is located in Camp Springs, Maryland, just outside the US capital. The base serves as the home of Air Force One, the US president's aircraft, and is used by other senior government officials.",

    "story": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

    "story": "Former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova loses battle with cancer Former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova has died from the cancer that forced him to retire from football at the end of last season. He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. \"FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems. Vilanova is survived by his wife and two children, including a son who now plays in Barcelona's youth academy. pfd/lw (AP, dpa, AFP)",
